            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>WHEN thoſe who oppoſe the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of <hi>LITUR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GIES</hi> had appealed to <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi> and boaſted it would diſown them; I concluded, they were obliged to ſtand to the Sentence of a Judge of their own chooſing<note n="(a)" place="margin">Acts xxv. 12.</note>; and therefore followed them to that Tribunal, before which they had brought their Cauſe:
<pb facs="tcp:56355:3"/> And when the Firſt <hi>Four Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> whoſe Authority is moſt vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and their Teſtimony the moſt convincing<note n="(b)" place="margin">Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas quo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piùs aberat ab ortu &amp; divinâ pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genie; hoc meliùs ea fortaſſe, quae erant vera cernebat. <hi>Cicer. Tuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cul.</hi> quaeſt.</note>, had given it on Our Side; It was the Opinion of ſome of my good Friends, that I need deſcend no lower, and might ſave the labour of a Second Part: But I conſidered, That though it was enough to ſuch as were Impartial, to prove that <hi>Liturgies</hi> began ſo Early; Yet others, who were prejudiced againſt them, would queſtion the Truth of that; unleſs I could clear the following Ages alſo from all the <hi>Objections,</hi> that their Friend hath raiſed out of them againſt this great Truth: He hath fixed the Original of <hi>Preſcribed Forms</hi> a <hi>Century</hi> or two Lower, and made a ſhew of proving, That the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of theſe <hi>Forms</hi> was left
<pb facs="tcp:56355:3"/> arbitrary, even till the beginning of the <hi>Ninth Century:</hi> And ſcattered divers Arguments in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places of his Book, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected out of ſome General Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, which could not be brought under any one of the Ancienter <hi>Fathers</hi> Names; nor Anſwered in the Firſt Part, becauſe they depended on Miſcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laneous Quotations, chiefly relating to the Time after the <hi>Fifth Century</hi> began. Wherefore I was compelled to follow him down through all theſe Later Ages; and ſhew, That <hi>Liturgies</hi> not only continued to be impoſed and uſed then; but were generally believed to have come down to them by Tradition from the moſt Eminent Biſhops of the Primitive and Apoſtolical Ages; and that his <hi>Objections</hi> rather confirm, than
<pb facs="tcp:56355:4"/> weaken this <hi>Aſſertion.</hi> I was obliged alſo to Examine every thing that looked like an <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> that I might neither give the obſtinate Occaſion, to call thoſe Reaſonings <hi>Invincible,</hi> which ſcarce deſerved a ſerious Anſwer<note n="(c)" place="margin">Tacere ultra non oportet, ne jam non verecundiae, ſed diffiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae eſſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipiat. <hi>Cypr.</hi> ad <hi>Demetr.</hi>
                     </note>; nor leave any Scruples in the Minds of ſuch as are willing to be undeceived: And for their ſakes, as well as to make this Hiſtory more compleat, I have added the <hi>Teſtimonies</hi> of the moſt Eminent <hi>Reformed Divines,</hi> both concerning the Antiquity and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſefulneſs of <hi>Liturgies</hi> in general, and concerning the Excellency of Our Churches <hi>Forms of Prayer.</hi> By all which it will appear, That ſuch as ſcruple to Hear or Read our <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> are ſo very ſingular in that Notion, that they are not only contrary
<pb facs="tcp:56355:4"/> to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, and to all Antiquity; but alſo to the Beſt and moſt Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of the <hi>Proteſtant Foreign Churches.</hi> 'Tis true, when Men have an Intereſt to ſerve, they will have no Inclination to yield to the cleareſt Demonſtration, nor to the plaineſt Matter of Fact: And therefore perhaps, Some of this Party may hope to run down all that is brought out of the Ages after the Year <hi>400,</hi> with the old Cry of <hi>POPERY</hi> and <hi>SUPERSTITION.</hi> But I would anticipate ſo weak an <hi>Objection,</hi> by obſerving, That their Friend led me into theſe Ages, and they muſt not blame me for following him. Again, There is nothing deſerves theſe hard Names in this later Period; but only that which was then firſt brought into the Church, and was
<pb facs="tcp:56355:5"/> not known nor uſed in purer Times: Now the Firſt Part ſufficiently proves, That Liturgies were none of the Inventions of theſe Ages; by ſhewing they were uſed and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved in the former Centuries, before any of thoſe Corruptions came in. I grant, that thoſe Copies of Ancient Liturgies which come to our hands, have many paſſages in them, which reliſh of the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition of later Ages: But then we are alſo ſure by thoſe Paſſages, which the Fathers cite out of them before they were corrupted, that they were pure at firſt, and theſe Exceptionable places have been tacked to them, long after they were firſt compoſed; Which the Compilers and Reformers of our Liturgy well underſtood, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though they imitated them, in all that was agreeable to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin
<pb facs="tcp:56355:5"/> and Practice of the Firſt Four <hi>Centuries,</hi> they cut off and reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the reſt, and ſo have redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Primitive way of Praying, to its Original purity, and ancient ſoundneſs. They knew the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Forms was very Ancient, the Corruption of thoſe Forms of later date: So that when they and other Reformed Churches have purged out all the Superſtitious Innovations, and reſtored the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Method of Serving God by preſcribed Forms, agreeably to the Scriptures, and the Practice and Opinions of the beſt Ages; I would hope, that all who are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to ſubmit to Truth, (by which it is every Mans intereſt to be conquered<note n="(d)" place="margin">Qui ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritati cedit utiliter vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citur. <hi>Petr. Damian.</hi> lib. 1. ep. 20.</note>) will renounce their groundleſs Prejudices, againſt this uſeful and Ancient Method of Praying. And no longer dote up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:56355:6"/> the new Extempore and Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary way, which was never uſed in public, (till of late) ſince the Ages of Inſpiration, whoſe practice can be no Rule to us, who have not thoſe extraordinary Gifts: And which is inconſiſtent with the Safety, the Honour and the Quiet of all Eſtabliſhed <hi>Churches.</hi> To conclude, The beſt Chriſtians and the moſt regular Churches in all Ages, have uſed and approved Forms of Prayer, and found great comfort in them, and much benefit by them. And if our Diſſenters would be content to ſerve God ſo alſo, they would then be capable of being Members of our Eſtabliſhed Church, and we ſhould no longer be diſturbed, weakned and endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered by this unhappy Separation. But ſo long as they retain this Fundamental Error, and profeſs
<pb facs="tcp:56355:6"/> their averſation to our whole way of Worſhip, All projects of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, and hopes of Accomodation are vain. And for that reaſon, I have ſo fully conſidered this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, and ſet all that relates to it in one Orderly View; becauſe it is Evident, that the Right Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation thereof, muſt be the firſt ſtep to that Peace, which is the Intereſt, and would be the Safety of this divided Nation; the Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare whereof all good Men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feignedly deſire.</p>

Concluding from theſe paſſages, That there could be then no ſetled Order or Form at <hi>Rome;</hi> and that which <hi>Innocent</hi> would have fixed was no more than a Rubric or Direction, and this for Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, not for ſtrict Conformity; ſo that in <hi>Innocents</hi> Time, every one in <hi>Italy</hi> Conſecrated as he thought fit. This is the ſum of his Inference.</p>
                     <p>In Anſwer to which I muſt obſerve, Firſt, That thoſe particulars which the Biſhop of <hi>Eugubium</hi> enquired about, and for which <hi>Innocent</hi> refers him to what he had ſeen uſed at <hi>Rome,</hi> were Rites and Ceremonies, as appears by the ſeveral Matters treated of in this
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56355:11"/> Epiſtle, <hi>viz.</hi> Cap. 1. <hi>Of the Kiſs of Peace.</hi> Cap. 2. <hi>Of reciting the Offerers Names.</hi> Cap. 3. <hi>Of the Anointing the Baptized.</hi> Cap. 4. <hi>Of the Saturday Faſt.</hi> Cap. 5. <hi>Of the Leavened Bread.</hi> Cap. 6, 7. <hi>Whether a Prieſt might lay Hands on the Poſſeſſed, and the Penitents.</hi> Cap. 8. <hi>Whether he might not Anoint the Sick.</hi> Now theſe things being all external Rites, which he might ſee and hear at <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſo commit to his Memory the Method uſed there, it was not neceſſary to refer him to the Roman Liturgy; nor doth it follow, there was no ſuch Liturgy for the Prayers themſelves, becauſe when the Pope was ask'd about the Rites and Cuſtoms of <hi>Rome,</hi> he doth not (as my Adverſary ſaith) refer him thither for ſatisfaction in theſe Matters. Yet, Secondly, this very Epiſtle makes it plain, they had certain Forms at <hi>Rome</hi> for their ſeveral Offices; for when he ſpeaks of Anointing the Baptized, he ſaith, <hi>Verba verò dicere non poſſum, ne magis prodere videar quam ad conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem reſpondere,</hi> Ibid. Cap. 3. <hi>I cannot tell you the words, leſt I betray the Church under pretence of anſwering your Queſtion.</hi> And ſo about the Forms uſed

Cap. 8. All which places neceſſarily ſuppoſe, they had certain and fixed Words, which were capable of being written down; but ſince in that Age divers (as he notes out of <hi>Chamier,</hi> pag. 41. Marg.) were not initiated, ſome being then Pagans, and others as yet but Catechumens; <hi>Innocent</hi> would not ſet down the Forms in a Letter, which might be intercepted or fall into the hands of ſuch as ought not to know theſe Sacred Myſteries. But now, if at <hi>Rome</hi> every Prieſt had prayed Extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore, and not only differed from others, but daily varied from himſelf; then <hi>Innocent</hi> could not have diſcourſed at this rate, but muſt have ſaid, <hi>As for the Words I cannot write them down, (not becauſe it is unlawful, but) becauſe it is impoſſible; for you know every Prieſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries them daily as he pleaſes.</hi> Wherefore this Notion of keeping the Words ſecret
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56355:12"/> (which was ſtrictly obſerved in that Age) proves they were ſtated Forms, capable of being writ down, and learned by Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers, if they had been publiſhed to them. And nothing can be weaker (to ſay no worſe) than to argue, as he doth, <hi>Innocent</hi> would not write the Forms in a Letter which might miſcarry; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were not written down in Books cloſely kept by the Biſhops and Prieſts at <hi>Rome.</hi> Thirdly, For his Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, <hi>That it was matter of Enquiry then, what place in the Euchariſtical Office ſhould be aſſigned to the Kiſs of</hi> Peace, <hi>and to the recital of the Offerers Names</hi>

For <hi>Eugubium</hi> was a ſmall Biſhopric under the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56355:12"/> Juriſdiction of the Roman Biſhops, as he was a Metropolitan; (being but 70 Miles diſtant from <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf) and he having no power over his Equals, gets the Popes Letter, under whoſe Juriſdiction all theſe Neighbour Biſhops of his were, thereby to unite them all, by conforming to their Mother Church, which (as <hi>Innocentius</hi> affirms) had one certain Form in theſe Offices received from S. <hi>Peter.</hi> Fourthly, Since this Biſhop was ſo deſirous to ſettle Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity even in theſe Ceremonies of far leſs concernment, we may reaſonably believe there was no difference in the Forms themſelves, that is, in the Prayers uſed in all Divine Offices by theſe Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops who lived ſo near to <hi>Rome;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, if they had varied in the ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial parts of the Office, <hi>Decentius</hi> muſt have complained principally of that Variety, and <hi>Innocents</hi> chief labour would have been to have agreed and ſetled that Matter, it being ridiculous for them to be ſo earneſt for Uniformity in Order and Ceremonies, if theſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Dioceſſes, had differed in the main, and had infinite variety in the Offices themſelves: ſo that both <hi>Innocent</hi> and

                        <hi>Decentius</hi> being ſilent as to any ſuch variety, gives us Reaſon to believe, they had all the ſame FORMS.

Where we ſee he requires he ſhould carefully inſtruct his own Clergy, in order to their ſtrict con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity no doubt; for otherwiſe, to what end did he teach them theſe Rules? And then he doth expect he ſhould give this Form to others, that is, to his neighbor Biſhops, and affirms it is their Duty to obſerve it; For ſince he is ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Acts and Ceremonies, there is no way to imitate them, but by doing them; there is no Medium between ſtrict Conformity, and total Non-conformity in theſe caſes; ſo that his diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Imitation and ſtrict Conformity, is nothing but Words without Senſe.

Again, if the Gift of Extempore making Prayers and Praiſes, for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Hours of Devotion had then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in the Church, it had been not only loſt labour, but a very bold thing

From whence he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, that the Prayers then could not be Forms Read out of a Book. But this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is eaſily bafled, by obſerving the true meaning of theſe Phraſes, <hi>to publiſh</hi> or <hi>bid the Prayer;</hi> Which is meant of the Preface to that ancient Litanick Form, repeated of old by the Deacon: And before he began, He ſummoned the People to be ready with their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſes after every Period, by Crying out aloud, <hi>Let us Pray,</hi> or <hi>Let us Pray earneſtly;</hi> Which Form is found in the beginning of the Greek Litanies to this very day. So that this Phraſe, ſuppoſes a Form in which all the People bore a part; and was Read or repeated by heart, by the Deacon (no matter whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.) And it was not only a Form it ſelf, but the Preface to a known Form; nor is the repeating of the Prayer called publiſhing, or bidding it, but the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:56355:31"/> for it, and the notice which the Deacon gave of it, with a loud Voice. Wherefore this Phraſe confutes his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and confirms ours.

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:56355:34"/> if every Dioceſs varied in the manner of Worſhiping God; but if every pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Miniſter at that time, had daily varied his Prayers and Praiſes, it had been very ridiculous in theſe Biſhops, to be affraid of ſeeming to differ in any thing: And in vain had they ſetled an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Rubries, if the ſubſtance and Words of the Prayers had been changed every day.

Since as to this Province, and with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to <hi>France,</hi> it is a very early De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, made ſoon after their Converſion to the Faith; and conſidering each great City, after the Barbarous inundation, was Converted by a ſeveral Biſhop, it is no wonder if there were ſome variety in their Liturgies: But we ſee, as ſoon as they had ſetled Chriſtianity it ſelf, their very next care was to ſettle one Liturgy; and probably other Provinces made the like Decree, though this only for this Age be now extant in the Councils. And if (as he ſaith) <hi>all things were ſo had</hi> here in this Country, in the very beginning of their Converſion; I would fain know, when things were better there, than when this Canon for an Uniform Liturgy was made; and I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it may be Noted, that <hi>Gregory</hi> of

                        </gap>n hundred Years, of this Council, aſſures us, That many of theſe very Biſhops had the Gift of Miracles; Yet did not pretend to that Gift of Extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore Praying, (which our Diſſenters boaſt of) but bound themſelves, and all their Subordinate Clergy, to one and the ſame Rule of holy Offices; and a Man would hope this Country was not ſo very bad, nor this Age ſo wicked, where the Biſhops were enabled to work Miracles, and while many of them were Confeſſors and Martyrs. Thus much for the Authority of this Council: And as to the meaning of the Canon, my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary leaves out one half of it, and recites no further than <hi>una ſit conſue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudo:</hi> So that his Reader may not ſee the <hi>unam Officiorum Regulam,</hi> One Rule for holy Offices; nor obſerve their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to have one Form for their Offices, as well as they had for their Creed; nor diſcern their fear of having any remarks made, if there were the leaſt variation in their Worſhip. This was all to be clapt under Hatches. Then he puts <hi>Sacrorum Ordo</hi> together; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>Ordo</hi> is joyned with <hi>Pſallendi.</hi> But
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:56355:36"/> that is no great matter, if he had not alſo falſly expounded this Word, <hi>Ordo,</hi> and told us, it ſignifies no more <hi>than the diſpoſing the Reſponſals, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Hymns and Pſalms, each in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place; which he would prove by the Council of</hi> Agatho, (held, he ſaith, not long after) <hi>where</hi> Ordo Eccleſiae <hi>is uſed only for a Rubric or Directory; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he thinks it cannot be inferred from hence, that the ſame Expreſſions were uſed by them that did Officiate</hi>
                        <note n="(o)" place="margin">Diſc. of Lit. pag. 174.</note> This is the ſum of his Arguing againſt the plain and genuine meaning of this Canon: But I ſhall eaſily ſhew it is all miſtake: For firſt, all thoſe Prayers which had Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſals in them, muſt neceſſarily be in known Forms, otherwiſe the People could not make certain Anſwers to them in their proper places; and that the <hi>Hymns</hi> and <hi>Pſalms</hi> were Forms alſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is moſt certain. Well then accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him, <hi>Ordo</hi> muſt be the diſpoſal of all the Reſponſory <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Praiſes,</hi> together with the <hi>Hymns</hi> and <hi>Pſalms,</hi> in that very Form of Words in which they were preſcribed, into their proper places: So that according to him, <hi>Ordo</hi> will ſignifie not only a
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:56355:36"/> bare Rubric, but a direction containing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>he Forms themſelves, as well as the Order of them: He can except nothing but the <hi>Prayers,</hi> and gives no ſhadow of a Reaſon why they ſhould not be put into Forms, as well as the <hi>Reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals, Hymns</hi> and <hi>Pſalms.</hi> And this is certain, that <hi>The Litany,</hi> which was the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ongeſt Prayer in all the Offices, and was in uſe at the Time of this Council (as I will ſhew in the next Section) was a Reſponſory Form; ſo that if this <hi>Ordo,</hi> did diſpoſe of that into its proper place, no doubt it alſo contained the very Form it ſelf; and he muſt need <hi>Hellebore</hi> who can imagine, that when the <hi>Litany,</hi> and the <hi>Hymns</hi> and <hi>Pſalms,</hi> were all preſcribed Forms, other Prayers ſhould be left arbitrary. Again, I hope this Canon may be allowed to expound it ſelf, and then this <hi>Order</hi> is enjoyned to be done in one manner, and after one Cuſtom; there was to be no more variety in it, than in their Creed, which was one conſtant Form of Words; yea, it is called <hi>One Rule of holy Offices,</hi> and ſo made, that none might obſerve the leaſt variety in any Church throughout the Province. Therefore if we joyn <hi>Ordo</hi>

Now here we have expreſs Teſtimony of a Common-Prayer, which this excellent Biſhop was wont to uſe; and it ſeems it was a Wonder in this Age to ſee any Clergy-man perform the public Office without a Book, which could not have been ſtrange, if my Adverſaries way of Extempore Prayer had been uſual: For if every Biſhop and Prieſt (as he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends) had daily prayed without Book, it had been ridiculous to have written this as a ſingular Excellency in <hi>Sidonius,</hi> to be able to repeat the Office by the ſtrength of his Memory without that Book, which uſed to guide him therein. And if it be Objected, That this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation ſeems rather to ſuppoſe he made a new Office Extempore: I Reply, That ſtill makes out my Aſſertion. Since it could not be the common way to pray on the ſudden, becauſe it was thought
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:56355:39"/> almoſt a Miracle in <hi>Sidonius</hi> to do ſo; therefore other Clergy-men generally uſed written Forms, and made uſe of Common-Prayer-Books, as we do now.

                     <p>WE need go no Lower for Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities to prove the Uſe of LITURGIES, becauſe our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary freely and frequently grants, that they began in the end of the Former and the beginning of This <hi>Century:</hi> But I muſt here note in general, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this Conceſſion, Firſt, That if they began no ſooner, yet they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to at leaſt <hi>Twelve-hundred Years,</hi> and to univerſal Practice and Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation for all that ſpace of Time, which cannot be proved concerning any thing that is a notorious Corruption. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, That the groſs Miſtake of laying the Original of them ſo late, is all along ſupported by perverting thoſe places, which ſpeak of reducing ſome Countries, which had been over-run by the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals, Hunnes</hi> and <hi>Franks,</hi> with other different ſorts of
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:56355:44"/> People, to one Form of Liturgy; As if theſe were meant of the firſt impoſing of Forms of Prayer in the Chriſtian Church. Whereas it is plain, that ſome of theſe Countries needed a New Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, and the various and different Inhabitants of other Provinces had brought in great variety of Rites; which this Age ſtrove to reduce to an Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, not by inventing a New Way, but by following the Primitive Way of eſtabliſhing One Liturgy for every Kingdom or Province.

Here then we ſee there is <hi>an Order of the Church,</hi> that is, (as the word then ſignified) <hi>A Liturgy,</hi> enjoyned to be obſerved by all in that Province, as it ſeems it was now by other Councils ſetled every where: Which Liturgy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of the <hi>Antiphons</hi> and <hi>Collects,</hi> every one ſet in its proper place, as alſo of Morning and Evening <hi>Hymns</hi> and <hi>Prayers,</hi> together with the <hi>Communion-Service</hi> (then called the <hi>Maſs</hi>) and the Reſponſory reading of the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> with a common or general Prayer for all Eſtates of Men, and all was concluded with the Biſhops Benediction.

For though we ſhould grant, That the Canon it ſelf do only direct the Order in which theſe ſeveral parts of the Service ſhall be uſed, and forbid the altering that Order; yet withal it refers to theſe ſeveral parts of the Service, and calls them by their proper Names, ſuppoſing a Book well known, in which they were written down in the ſame order which is preſcribed by this Canon. It is plain, the <hi>Antiphons, Hymns, Collects, &amp;c.</hi> were certain fixed Forms, not made in this Council, but ſuppoſed to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly known by all long before; and ſince ſome variety in the reciting theſe Forms had crept in, ſo as one Dioceſs differed ſomewhat from another, that
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:56355:47"/> Variety (though it were but in the order of uſing theſe Forms) is forbid here; and the ſame Uniformity eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in this Province, which had been ſetled every where elſe: And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed this Canon convinces me, there was no difference in the Forms them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the ſame <hi>Antiphons, Hymns, Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects, &amp;c.</hi> were uſed every where, that needed not any regulation, only they were differently placed in the Liturgies of divers Churches; and this they Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, by ſetling one Liturgy for the whole <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, which is called <hi>Ordo Eccleſiae;</hi> and This <hi>Order</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained not only the <hi>Rubrics,</hi> or diſpoſal of theſe ſeveral parts of Service, but alſo The Forms themſelves ſo diſpoſed and ſet in Order: And doubtleſs, if any had then been ſo bold to vary the Hymns and Forms of Prayer, theſe Fathers (who would not ſuffer any Variety in the method and placing them) would much leſs have endured the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of altering the Words and Expreſſions: but that was a piece of Confidence, that was not heard of in this Age.</p>

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:56355:51"/> all the Churches of the World, and believed to have deſcended down to them, from the moſt ancient Times: For the Biſhops in this Council ſay, <hi>That ſince it was the cuſtom in the Eaſt, at</hi> Rome, <hi>and in all</hi> Italy <hi>to repeat the</hi> Kyrie Eleeſon <hi>[Lord have Mercy upon us]; Therefore in all our Churches, this holy Cuſtom ſhall be introduced, to ſay it in the Morning Prayer, at the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and at Evening Prayer</hi>

                        </note>. The Form was ancient and uſed in all the Primitive Litanies, but in theſe Churches they had not begun to repeat theſe Words in the Daily Offices, at the three great Hours of Prayer: But ſince it was become a Cuſtom in all other Countries, ſo to uſe this holy Form, they now preſcribe it ſhall be ſo uſed in their Churches, as it is ſtill in our Liturgy, immediately before the Lords Prayer. Again, the ſame Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil ordains, <hi>That the Communion Service, ſhall never be ſaid without the Hymn, of Holy, Holy, Holy,</hi> that is, the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſagion;</hi> which though it was preſcribed by their Liturgy before, yet ſome, in the time of Lent, and in private Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munions, had thought fit to omit it<note n="(x)" place="margin">Ibid.

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:56355:51"/> ſo that the variations which Biſhops had made from the old way, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated by the Councils of this Age. The next Canon affirms, <hi>That at</hi> Rome, <hi>in the Eaſt, in</hi> Africa <hi>and</hi> Italy, <hi>they had for preventing Hereſie, added to the</hi> Gloria Patri, <hi>theſe Words,</hi> As it was in the beginning, <hi>&amp;c.

                        <note n="(y)" place="margin">Ibid. Can. 5. p. 642.</note>. The Form, with this enlargment alſo, had been long in uſe in other Churches, but this Addition was firſt Eſtabliſhed in <hi>France,</hi> after its ſecond Converſion, by this Canon. And we gather from hence, that in this Age there is not only an aſſurance, that every Nation had a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy; but that the leſſer Churches, laboured to imitate the greater and more famous Churches, in order to the making as great an Uniformity as was poſſible, in all the Liturgies then in the World: And we ſhall finally note, from this Councils Orders about theſe ancient Forms; that private Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops themſelves, in this Age, were not allowed to correct or alter any thing relating to the Liturgy; Nothing leſs than a Council might preſume to
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:56355:52"/> make Orders in thoſe Caſes. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we cannot imagin that Liturgies, were lately ſet up in the end of the laſt Age, or the beginning of this, (as my Adverſary affirms) much leſs, can we think that private Miniſters, had leave to vary the Offices as they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>

Which ſhews not only, that there was a Form of Prayer for the Church, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing the Catholic Faith, in the time of <hi>Vigilius;</hi> but that the Form was then
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:56355:56"/> believed to be from ancient Tradition, and was made almoſt in the very Words, which had been uſed for many hundred Years before. Had Liturgies been newly ſet up, (as my Adverſary pretends) nothing had been more falſe, nor more Ridiculous, than to alledge an ancient Tradition for this Form; and had all Miniſters before this had the liberty to Pray, in what Expreſſions they pleaſed, nothing had been more impoſible, than this Harmony between theſe Offices, which only differ in divers Ages, by reaſon of the ſeveral Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the Forms, but were always in every Age done by a preſcribed Form. Which will be ſtill more plain by the ſame <hi>Vigilius</hi> his Anſwer to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultations of <hi>Etherius,</hi> whom he firſt informs concerning the certain Time on which <hi>Eaſter</hi> was to be kept for that year: And becauſe this Biſhop was placed in a Country newly converted to the Catholic Faith, and not yet well inſtructed in the regular way of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming Divine Offices, he had (it ſeems) deſired to know how they celebrated the Service at <hi>Rome</hi> on the greater Feſtivals: To which <hi>Vigilius</hi> gives this Anſwer, <hi>We
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:56355:57"/> alſo acquaint you, that as to the Order of Prayer in celebrating the Communion, it is not different at any time, nor upon any Feſtival; but we always conſecrate the Gifts offered to God after the ſame Manner</hi> — Then he goes on to tell him, <hi>That they had indeed proper Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faces, for commemorating the Mercy pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly to be remembred in each of the greater Feſtivals</hi> — And then adds theſe Words, — <hi>But the reſt of the Service we perform according to the accuſtomed Order: And therefore we have herewith ſent you the Text it ſelf of that Canonical Prayer, which by Gods Mercy we have received from Apoſtolical Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.

Here we ſee the Communion-Service, and eſpecially the Prayer of <hi>Conſecration,</hi> was an ancient Form derived from Apoſtolical Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the whole Office was written down in a Book, and ſent into that Country where <hi>Etherius</hi> was Biſhop,

And if ſo, probably this was the foundation of that Office which is called the <hi>Moſarabick,</hi> and was Compoſed by S. <hi>Leander</hi> about Fifty year after, out of the old <hi>Gothic</hi> and <hi>African</hi> Forms, compared with this <hi>Roman</hi> Office. However it appears, that though in ſome places, where the Faith was newly planted, they needed help to ſettle and correct their Offices; yet both the New and Ancient Churches did all agree in the uſe of Forms: And when a new Liturgy was to be made for a Newly Converted Nation, the Biſhops conſulted the moſt Ancient Forms they could find in other Churches, chooſing out of them what they thought proper for their own Country, and that Form they enjoyned upon all that were under their Juriſdiction. We muſt alſo obſerve further, That the <hi>Roman</hi> Office which was writ down, and the very Words of it ſent to this Biſhop, is called, <hi>An Order of Prayer:</hi> Which therefore doth not ſignifie a bare Rubric for Method, but a <hi>Book containing the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faces, Hymns and Prayers themſelves:</hi>

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:56355:60"/> before. Wherefore for theſe Mattens and Veſpers, they had eſtabliſhed <hi>One Order.</hi> Beſides theſe, there was the Communion-Office before Noon, and for that they had alſo a Preſcribed Form; which they call here, <hi>The Eccleſiaſtical Rule;</hi> and ſince ſome private Perſons preſumed to alter this, and others fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed ſome of the Forms preſcribed by the Rules of certain Monaſteries, they utterly reject theſe Variations, and bind them all to the public Liturgy. This is the plain ſenſe of the Canon, and therefore <hi>Ordo Pſallendi,</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſtica Regula,</hi> muſt be more than a Rubric; for theſe confined them to Sing the Mattens and Veſpers in the ſame words, and to celebrate the <hi>Communion-Service</hi> by ſuch a certain Rule as admitted of no Varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And the following Canons make this ſtill more plain: The Second is, <hi>That on the Vigils of Feaſts, and at the Communion, all ſhall read the ſame, and not different Leſſons in the Church.</hi> The Third orders, <hi>That Biſhops and Prieſts ſhall uſe the ſame Form of Saluting the People,</hi> viz.

Here we have one Kalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar fixed, appointing the very ſame Leſſons; one Form of Salutation, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from the Apoſtles; one Written Form for the celebration of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt; and another, being the Order of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> which in the days of a Biſhop (who was dead ſome years before this Council) were ſent in Writing from <hi>Rome,</hi> and had been ever ſince uſed in theſe Provinces; which can be nothing elſe but a Liturgy, from which they will not ſuffer any Miniſter to vary in the leaſt. And it ſignifies nothing to alledge, That this is one of the firſt Injunctions for ſuch Uniformity in this Country, that had been for an Age and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:56355:61"/> more over-run with Barbarous People, and overſpread with Hereſies; becauſe there are evident Suppoſals, That the Ancient Churches, which had not been renverſed by theſe Calamities, but kept to their old accuſtomed Ways, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the New regulated Churches with ancient Forms, which had been uſed among them from the Primitive Ages; and that ſufficiently proves the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of Liturgies. My Adverſary, who conceals all this Evidence, cites the 30th Canon of this Council, but very falſly; for he reads it thus, <hi>Beſides the Pſalms of the Old Teſtament, let nothing Poetically Compoſed be Sung in the Church;</hi> and he falſe dates it alſo<note n="(z)" place="margin">Diſc. of Lit. pag. 179. Concil. <hi>Bracar.</hi> Can. 30. An. 565.</note>. But the Words of the Canon are a Tranſlation of the Canon of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> made 200 years before, Forbidding the Singing of any Poetical Compoſitions in the Church, except the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and what Hymns were taken out of the Canonical Books of the Old and New Teſtament<note n="(a)" place="margin">Vid. <hi>Bin.</hi> Tom. 2. par. 2. pag. 212.</note>; which was deſigned, to ſet aſide the late compoſed Hymns of the <hi>Arians,</hi> uſed among the Heretical <hi>Goths,</hi> and other corrupt modern Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſures: Not to reject the <hi>Magnificat,</hi>

                        <note n="(d)" place="margin">Ib. Can. 24. pag. 230.</note>. So that we ſee, this Canon owns the <hi>Te Deum,</hi> the <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicite,</hi> and other Hymns, provided they be Orthodox, and the Authors were
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:56355:62"/> known Friends to the Catholic Faith; and here are Forms ſuppoſed as gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally uſed, and a Council to allow them, after which the Church may uſe them, though they be not taken out of Canonical Scripture. I have no more to add here, but a ſcattered Paſſage or two, to confirm the continuance of the old Forms in the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church. Firſt, Whereas there was a neceſſity of leaving the Prieſt at liberty, to put the Names of thoſe who Offered, into the Prayer for all Eſtates of Men, ſome ventured to take more freedom, and in that part of the Office varied from their Mother Church: Which occaſion'd a Council at <hi>Arles</hi> to Decree, <hi>That the Oblations made at the Holy Altar, ſhould not be offered up by any of the Biſhops of that Province, otherwiſe than according to the Form uſed in the Church of</hi> Arles<note n="(e)" place="margin">Concil. <hi>Arelat.</hi> An.

                        <note n="(c)" place="margin">Diſc. of Lit. pag. 83, 84, 85, 86, 87.</note>. The former of theſe Aſſertions he proves from a Paſſage in Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> his Epiſtles, which the ignorant editor of the <hi>Diſcourſe of Liturgies</hi> hath put into a wrong Page: But I ſhall cite it at large, and then will examine the true meaning of it: <hi>We therefore ſay the Lords Prayer immediately after the Prayer</hi> (of Conſecration), <hi>becauſe it was the cuſtom of the Apoſtles with that Prayer alone to Conſecrate the Hoſt; and it ſeems to me very inconvenient, that we ſhould ſay over the Hoſt that Prayer which a Scholaſtical Man had compoſed, and not ſay that Form which our Lord himſelf compoſed, over his Body and Blood</hi>

                        </note>.

<pb n="122" facs="tcp:56355:68"/> and miſtakes of which Inference we ſhall eaſily perceive, if we conſider the occaſion and the ſenſe of theſe Words: S. <hi>Gregory</hi> was accuſed for imitating the Cuſtom at <hi>Conſtantinople, In ordering the Lords Prayer to be repeated imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after the Canon;</hi> and theſe Words are his defence of his bringing in this Cuſtom. Now doubtleſs it had been more rational, to object his ſetting up a New Canon made by a late obſcure Author, if he had done any ſuch thing, than to alledge his only adding the Lords Prayer to it; and if he had firſt brought in this Canon of <hi>Scholaſticus,</hi> that had been an imitation of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> too, ſo far as it was a Canon; for they had long uſed the Canon of S. <hi>Baſil,</hi> and that of S. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> there; but of this the Objectors take no notice, which makes it probable, that the Canon was ſetled long before; it was a Prayer which he found, and added the <hi>Lords Prayer</hi> to it. But my Adverſary urges S. <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Saying, That the Apoſtles only Conſecrated with the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> and therefore <hi>Scholaſticus</hi> his Canon muſt be compoſed about S. <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Time.

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:56355:69"/> Divine Perſon, ſuch as the <hi>Lords Prayer</hi> is, to one made by an human Author, by a Learned and Scholaſtical Man; by which he means either in general, all the old Popes who firſt put in the ſeveral Parts; or rather <hi>Gelaſius,</hi> who ſetled the Canon made up of thoſe Parts, and ſo may be ſaid to be the Author thereof: And thus all my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries dreams of a Man called <hi>Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſticus,</hi> contemporary to S. <hi>Gregory,</hi> fall to the ground.

                           <hi>Bellarm.</hi> de Miſſ. lib. 2. c. 19.</note> only recites this as <hi>Chem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitius</hi>'s Opinion, but diſputes againſt it; and yet adds, if he ſhould yield this to gratifie his Adverſary, it would not follow that the Canon was made by him, becauſe S. <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Words may be expounded, not of the Canon, but of ſome leſſer Collects, of later compoſure, uſed in the <hi>Communion-Office;</hi> and then adds, <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>traque probabilis,</hi> both Opinions, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Canon being made by an ancient Learned Father, entituled <hi>Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſticus,</hi> and of the Words ſignifying <hi>other Prayers,</hi> are probable: But my
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:56355:70"/> Adverſary wilfully perverts <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> as if he affirmed, it was probable that <hi>Scholaſticus</hi> (Author of the Canon) lived in <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Time; which the Cardinal utterly and with good Reaſon denies, becauſe there was a Canon at <hi>Rome</hi> divers Ages before; and that which <hi>Gregory</hi> here ſpeaks of, was writ down by <hi>Gelaſius</hi> before the End of the laſt Century. And here let it be noted, That though S. <hi>Gregory</hi> prefer the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> whoſe Authority was Divine, before this Prayer of Eccleſiaſtical and Human Compoſition, yet he gives great regard to it; for he calls the Elements only, <hi>The Hoſt,</hi> or <hi>The Oblation,</hi> before this Canon be repeated; but after the pronouncing this Prayer over it, he calls it <hi>Chriſts Body</hi> and <hi>Blood:</hi> Which ſhews, That he thought the Conſecration was made by this very Prayer, though it were only an Human Compoſure. And this was not his Opinion alone, but was believed generally in that Age, as may appear by the Caſe of <hi>Januarius</hi> (propoſed to <hi>Gregory</hi>) who was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times taken ſo ill, even at the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that he was a great while before he could go on at the ſame place of
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:56355:70"/> the Canon, where he left off; which made many doubt, whether or no they might receive the Communion from him, becauſe they feared, that a Miſtake in this Prayer would make the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration null<note n="(s)" place="margin">
                           <hi>Gregor.</hi> Epiſt. 56. lib. 11. pag.</note>. Now it is no way probable, that a Prayer lately made by an obſcure and private Man, ſhould ſo ſuddenly gain the reputation of being a neceſſary part of the Office: And therefore we may conclude this firſt Aſſertion of his to be falſe, and no way deducible from S. <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Words, ſince it oppoſes ſo much Reaſon and ſo great Authority. But Secondly, Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever made this Canon, or whenſoever it was made, my Adverſary ſaith, That S. <hi>Gregory</hi> was not for impoſing it; which he hopes to prove by his not impoſing this Canon upon <hi>Auguſtine</hi> the Monk, whom he had ſent to Convert the <hi>Saxons</hi> then in this Iſland; <hi>For he adviſed him to a Courſe inconſiſtent with any reſtraint.</hi> Now all this is to inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate, that it is ill done of our Church to impoſe her Liturgy upon her own Clergy, becauſe (as he pretends) <hi>Bede</hi> ſaith, S. <hi>Gregory</hi> did not impoſe the <hi>Roman</hi> Canon on <hi>Auſtin</hi> the Monk.
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:56355:71"/> An heavy Charge this, and well proved, as we ſhall ſee by the true Quotation of <hi>Bede</hi>'s Words, half of which my Adverſary hath left out: <hi>Auguſtine</hi> had enquired, why ſince there was but One Faith, there were divers Liturgies, and in this caſe, which he ſhould chuſe to eſtabliſh here? And <hi>Bede</hi> thus relates S. <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Anſwer: <hi>Your Brotherhood knows the Cuſtom of the</hi> Roman <hi>Church, in which you were brought up; but I am content, that whatever you can find in the</hi> Roman, <hi>the</hi> Gallican, <hi>or any Church, which may beſt pleaſe Almighty God, you do carefully chuſe that</hi> — [here He fraudulently draws a Line] — [But <hi>Bede</hi> goes on thus—] <hi>And infuſe into your New Converted Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>by a ſpecial Inſtitution, what you ſo gather from ſeveral Churches</hi> [— Here he comes in again—] <hi>For things are not to be beloved for the places ſake, but places are to be beloved for the good things that are there; wherefore out of every Church chooſe ſuch things as are pious, religious and right</hi> — [Here he concludes, but S. <hi>Gregory</hi> goes on] — <hi>and gathering theſe into one Collection, depoſit them for Cuſtoms in the Minds of

For S. <hi>Gregory</hi> ſuppoſes every Church had a Written Liturgy, which <hi>Auguſtin</hi> might read over and compare: And he adviſes <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> to read over the ſeveral Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies of ſeveral Churches, the <hi>Roman,</hi> the <hi>Gallican, &amp;c.</hi> and out of all theſe, to compoſe One Form, and then to enjoyn it on the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and by daily uſe to accuſtom them to it. This is all the Reſtraint that is practiſed now: Our Reformers did read over all Liturgies,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:56355:72"/> and choſe out the beſt things from each, put them together in one Volume, and then required theſe Forms ſhould be daily uſed, ſo that both Prieſts and People might be accuſtomed to them. And as S. <hi>Gregory</hi> did not impoſe the <hi>Roman</hi> Liturgy or Canon upon <hi>Auguſtin</hi> the Monk, who lived in a diſtant Country and in a diſtinct National Church; ſo we do not impoſe ours upon <hi>Denmark</hi> or <hi>Sweden,</hi> upon the <hi>Dutch</hi> or the <hi>Helvetians:</hi> But to argue from hence, We are not for impoſing our own Liturgy upon our own Clergy, is ſo weak, ſo obvious a Fallacy, as deſerves to be laughed at rather than ſeriouſly confuted. Again, becauſe <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> (the Patriarch of the Weſt) took the liberty to correct the <hi>Roman</hi> Offices, by that which he approved of, in the Forms of other National Churches<note n="(w)" place="margin">Diſc. of Liturgies, p. 87.</note>: And becauſe he would not impoſe the Trine Immerſion uſed at <hi>Rome,</hi> upon <hi>Leander</hi>'s New Converted, diſtant Church in <hi>Spain</hi>

                           <hi>Gregor.</hi> Ep. 41. ad <hi>lae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anat.</hi> lib. 1.</note>; Therefore every Pariſh-Prieſt and private Miniſter may vary from the Liturgy of his own Church daily, if he pleaſe: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no Biſhops ought to impoſe any
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:56355:72"/> Liturgy upon their own Clergy, living under them in the ſame Dioceſs or Nation. This is ſuch woful Sophiſtry, that I am ſure he cannot impoſe this ſort of Arguing upon any rational Men; yet if theſe Inferences be not drawn from S. <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Anſwer, it makes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to his purpoſe, unleſs it be to prove, there were no Forms impoſed in <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Time. But how can that be ſqueezed out of any of theſe Paſſages? The Epiſtle firſt cited, ſuppoſes a Form of Prayers extant, and impoſed at <hi>Rome</hi> before S. <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Time, wherein the <hi>Hallelujah</hi> was never ſung but between <hi>Eaſter</hi> and <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> which ordered the Sub-Deacons to wear Surplices when they ſang the Litany in Proceſſions; in which Litany by the old Form they did not repeat the <hi>Kyrie Eleeſon</hi> often; nor was the <hi>Lords Prayer</hi> in the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion Office of that old Book, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to be uſed immediately after the Canon: But this Epiſtle ſhews, that <hi>Gregory</hi> had altered the ancient Liturgy of <hi>Rome</hi> in all theſe Particulars, and made it agreeable to the Liturgy at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> from which place he was lately come: And this he was cenſured for

Wherefore here was a Form impoſed before his Time, and he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes it again (with his Corrections) upon his own Church, or elſe what need the Clergy under his Juriſdiction complain? Indeed he did not impoſe it on <hi>Spain, France</hi> or <hi>Britain,</hi> which were not (in that Age) under his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; but he was ſtrict enough at <hi>Rome,</hi> and in the Churches then ſubject to that See: He corrected the Book of <hi>Gelaſius,</hi> and impoſed that there; <hi>He compiled</hi> Hymns <hi>and</hi> Antiphons, <hi>and brought in a New way of Singing them, teaching Boys to do it with skill, ſo that ſoon after all the Weſt imitated that Way</hi>

Which ſhews the Forms were then well known, and had been ſo long uſed, as to be underſtood by ſhort hints in this Epitome of the <hi>Gregorian</hi> Office: But my Adverſary knew well, that the <hi>Sacramentary</hi> of <hi>Gregory</hi> is extant in his Works, wherein all the <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Antiphons, &amp;c.</hi> are ſet down at large which <hi>Gregory</hi> made and impoſed on the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and therefore it is
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:56355:74"/> diſingenuous in him, to argue for his pretended liberty from this Epitome. There is but one thing more in my Adverſary relating to this Matter, which is, That <hi>Auguſtin</hi> being not impoſed on by S <hi>Gregory,</hi> would not impoſe it on the <hi>Britains</hi>
                        <note n="(d)" place="margin">Diſc. of Lit. pag. 87, &amp; 88.</note>; which he gathers from this, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Britains</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> were Enemies to the <hi>Roman</hi> Uſe in <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> his Time, and had no Uniformity in Worſhip long after. Now to his Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I ſay, That if <hi>Auguſtin</hi> followed <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Advice (as no doubt he did) then he did impoſe, not the <hi>Roman</hi> Forms, but thoſe of his own collecting, upon the <hi>Saxons,</hi> which I ſhall prove more largely afterwards: But as for the <hi>Britains,</hi> they were a diſtinct Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church then, and did owe no manner of ſubjection to <hi>Auguſtin;</hi> ſo that it had been ridiculous i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Again, as to his Proof, How doth the <hi>Britains</hi> rejecting the <hi>Roman</hi> Uſe in <hi>Gildas</hi>'s Time, prove, That they had no Forms impoſed on them
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:56355:74"/> by <hi>Auguſtin? Gildas</hi> died (according to Biſhop <hi>

Beſides, The <hi>Roman</hi> Liturgy and <hi>Auguſtin</hi>'s were two diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent things, and therefore it is very weak to prove, they did not receive <hi>Auguſtin</hi>'s Liturgy from their rejecting the <hi>Roman</hi> Uſage, ſince they were different things: So that this would be a good Argument, if it were not as deſtitute of Logic and Chronology, as it is of Truth; For <hi>Auguſtin</hi> did make a Form, and impoſe it on the <hi>Saxons</hi> under his Juriſdiction, and they received it, and uſed it long after. As for the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, Scots</hi> and <hi>Iriſh,</hi> in that Age, they belonged not to him, and ſo he could impoſe nothing on them: And for their Uniformity, I ſhall clear that Point after a little while.

Now this extraordinary Veneration for theſe <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies</hi> could proceed from nothing, but their having been long uſed in the Eaſtern Church, and their aſſurance of their great Antiquity and Excellency. And if private Miniſters had then enjoyed ſuch a liberty in varying the public Prayers, according to their own Fancies and Conceptions; This Author could not have been ſo ridiculous, as to repreſent this as ſo heinous a Crime in a Biſhop. So that we may conclude this Century alſo, wherein we find the Uſe of <hi>Liturgies</hi> every where continued, and by all the Fathers and Councils of this Age they are ſpoken of with much Reverence, and repreſented as delivered from the Apoſtles and Primitive Biſhops, and as the ancient way of Serving God; being no where firſt introduced in this Period, but only in Countries newly Converted: And the great buſineſs of many Councils in this Time was, to reduce thoſe Nations which had variety

                     <p>TO gather up all the Evidence for LITURGIES in this and the following Ages, would be a needleſs Trouble to the Reader and my ſelf; both becauſe what I have ſo clearly made out to begin much ſooner, can receive no great ſtrength from the Writers of this declining Age; and becauſe my Adverſary doth confeſs, they began to be impoſed above one whole Century before the beginning of this: Yet ſince he will go on to lower Times, to plead for the continuance of his imaginary Liberty, I ſhall follow him, and not only confute his Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but collect alſo (which he hath omitted) ſome of the moſt remarkable

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:56355:79"/> Differences were Scandalous to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and an Offence to the People, while they did continue. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Therefore they ſettle one Form of Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Evening Prayers, and one Form of Communion-Service, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the Dominions of <hi>Siſenandus,</hi> who Ruled all <hi>Spain;</hi> and in ſome Parts of <hi>France,</hi> lately gained by his Anceſtors, they now will have but one Order, that is, One Liturgy (as that Word ſignifies) without the leaſt diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. And ſince <hi>Iſidore</hi> had ſo lately corrected and compleated <hi>Leander</hi>'s Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and was Preſident here, we may conclude, that this Canon was to ſettle that very Liturgy: And becauſe ſome Biſhops might be ſo much in love with their former ways of Service, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Authority of ſo great a Council they would not change them, there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low divers Canons to forbid the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars wherein they differed, and to ſettle thoſe preſcribed in the <hi>Mozarabic</hi> Office; of which being many, I will only repeat the Heads, which are theſe: <hi>The</hi> 5th <hi>Canon forbids the Trine Immer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in Baptiſm, and orders it to be done but once: The</hi> 6th <hi>enjoyns all to

For thoſe Canons do all ſuppoſe there had been divers Liturgies, appointing a various uſe of thoſe Forms; but ſince now one <hi>Liturgy</hi> was eſtabliſhed (as the Second Canon ſhews) they add the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of a National Council to that One Order agreed on, and forbid all former ways which did in the leaſt vary from it; and conſidering how apt Men are to be tenacious of their own Way, which they have long uſed, all
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:56355:83"/> theſe Canons were little enough to ſecure and reſtore the ancient Uniformity; yea, the very Reaſon given in this 25th Canon, why the Biſhop delivered this Book of Offices to every Pariſh-Miniſter at his Ordination, is, that they might Officiate by none of the Old <hi>Liturgies,</hi> but by this alone; and when theſe Country-Miniſters came to their Biſhop, either upon occaſion of the Grand Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion uſed when the <hi>Litany</hi> was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly ſaid by the whole Clergy of the Dioceſs, or at thoſe Synods which were then held at leaſt once a year; Then he might bring this Book along with him to certifie the Biſhop, that he had uſed no other Forms, but theſe eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, in any Offices of his Miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now had this been only a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory,</hi> according to my Adverſaries extravagant Fancy, ſome might offend Chriſt out of Ignorance, by not chooſing or making proper Forms; and it had been impoſſible they ſhould all have agreed ſo exactly in every Office (as the Second Canon requires) that the People could not obſerve the leaſt difference. To conclude, The Fathers of this Council tell us in the 13th Canon, <hi>That divers
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:56355:83"/> Hymns uſed in the Church were compoſed by the Eccleſiaſtical Doctors; and if any for that Reaſon would not uſe them, they muſt alſo reject the Forms of Prayer: For</hi> (ſay they) <hi>theſe Hymns are compoſed, as Maſſes, or Supplications, or Prayers, or Commendations</hi> (that is, Interceſſions for all Eſtates of Men) <hi>or Impoſitions of Hands, are Compoſed: Which, if they might not be ſaid in the Church, all Eccleſiaſtical Offices muſt ceaſe:</hi> And therefore they conclude, <hi>That as none of them did refuſe ſuch Compoſed Prayers; ſo none of them for the future ought to reject Hymns, ſo Compoſed for the Praiſe of God</hi>

I ſuppoſe he will grant the Hymns were Forms of Praiſe in Words at large, made by ancient Holy Fathers: And they declare, that their Communion-Service, their Prayers, their Collects, Interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Forms of Abſolving Penitents, were compoſed juſt as the Hymns were compoſed, <hi>viz.</hi> in Words writ down at large by Ancient Doctors; ſo that if any Men had then been of our Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Principle, to uſe no Human Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſures
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:56355:84"/> in the Church (except their own) all Divine-Service muſt have ceaſed; becauſe they had no other way to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it by, but by a fixed Liturgy, in which theſe Old Forms were ſet down: But they were ſo happy, that none ſcrupled to uſe theſe Prayers then, either becauſe they were Forms, or becauſe they were made by Ancient Doctors; and thence the Council Argues very firmly, That it was ridiculous for them to uſe preſcribed Forms of Prayer of Human Compoſure, and at the ſame time to ſcruple the uſe of Hymns, that were Compoſed after the ſame manner. This ſufficiently proves, it was a Liturgy at large, which was writ in this Book of Offices; and ſo we may diſmiſs him and his <hi>Directory,</hi> as having no Foundation in, or Encouragement from this Council. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He cites a Rule of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi>'s, ſaid to be praiſed in this Synod of <hi>Toledo, viz. That where there is one Faith, there's no hurt to the Church by diverſity of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſages</hi>

But <hi>Gregory</hi> himſelf, and theſe who cite him, apply this Rule only to a Ceremony in Baptiſm, which he thought might be uſed variouſly in divers Churches, without any prejudice to that One Faith wherein they agreed; and therefore though <hi>Trine Immerſion</hi> was uſed at <hi>Rome,</hi> he would not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it on <hi>Spain:</hi> But what is this, or the Cenſure upon <hi>Victor</hi> in <hi>Euſebius,</hi> for impoſing the <hi>Roman</hi> way of Faſting upon the Eaſtern Church, to our Queſtion about the lawfulneſs of a National Churches impoſing one Liturgy upon her own Members? <hi>Gregory</hi> did moſt certainly impoſe <hi>Trine Immerſion</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Leander</hi> and this Council impoſed <hi>Single Immerſion</hi> on <hi>Spain;</hi> Nor did any blame <hi>Victor</hi> for impoſing his way of Faſting, and keeping <hi>Eaſter,</hi> upon his own Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and its Dependants.

I Reply, The Words of the Canon ſhew this to be a Miſtake: For they ſay, <hi>That the whole Catholic Church through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the World celebrates this Hymn, and that only ſome of the</hi> Spaniſh <hi>Clergy neglected to ſing it at ſome ſolemn Times,</hi> viz. <hi>On Sundays and Holy-days; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they Decree it ſhall be ſung in all the Churches of</hi> France <hi>and</hi> Spain <hi>in all ſolemn Maſſes, and that they who omitted this ancient Cuſtom, and broke this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, ſhould be deprived of the Communion.</hi> Now how could the whole Catholic Church agree in the uſe of this Hymn, if it had not been impoſed? Had all Churches been at liberty (as he fancies) ſome of them would have uſed it, and others not. Again, how comes this Council to call it, <hi>an ancient Cuſtom,</hi>
                        <pb n="157" facs="tcp:56355:85"/> if this were the firſt time it was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed? Or why do they ſay, it was Negligence in thoſe few who omitted it, if it were not a Duty before? It is plain enough, that this Hymn was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently preſcribed; but ſome Scrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous perſons, by miſtaking the Canons of <hi>Laodicea</hi> and <hi>Braga,</hi> as if they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad all Hymns, which were not taken out of holy Scripture, would not obey the Injunction, nor uſe this Hymn at ſolemn Times: This indeed may prove that ſome of the Clergy then did neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect to read the whole Office, (and yet it ſhews that to be a great fault,) but it doth not prove that this Hymn was never enjoyned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it rather ſuppoſes the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.

But about 30 years after, <hi>Amalarius</hi> a buſy Monk, pretends to bring a new <hi>Antiphonary</hi> from <hi>Rome,</hi> Corrected after the Roman Office, in the time of <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> the Fourth; which he preſented to <hi>Lewis</hi> the Godly, and hoped by his Authority, to impoſe it on all the <hi>Galli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> Church. But <hi>Agobardus</hi> the Primate of <hi>France,</hi> rejects this new <hi>Antiphonary,</hi> and writ a Book to prove there were Hereſies, Blaſphemies and Nonſenſe, in theſe Hymns of <hi>Amalarius,</hi> and keeps to the old Roman <hi>Antiphonary,</hi> eſtabliſhed by his Predeceſſor, the Hymns of which were for the moſt part taken out of the Pſalms, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of Holy Scripture, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending

<pb n="194" facs="tcp:56355:104"/> Which <hi>Lotharius</hi> had been Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by Pope <hi>Nicolas,</hi> for living in Adultery with one <hi>Waldrada,</hi> and <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharius</hi> came to <hi>Rome</hi> for Abſolution, and promiſed for ever to Renounce her; for the ſecurity of which promiſe, this Pope obliges him to take the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament upon it, together with his Nobles: And upon that Extraordinary Occaſion, <hi>poſt Miſſarum Solennia,</hi> after the uſual Conſecration, the Pope ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſome words for that once only; which was to let them know their Danger, if they did Diſſemble in ſo Solemn an Ordinance; but ſo, that probably either before or after, he uſed the old Form of diſtribution, which the Hiſtorians alſo intimate; though ſince this is only an Hiſtorical Narration, they have not perhaps ſo clearly expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it: However, what can my Adverſary infer from hence to his purpoſe, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing <hi>Adrian</hi> mixed the Form of diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution, for this once, with his occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Commination<note n="(z)" place="margin">Diſc. of Lit. p. 91, 92.</note>?

<pb n="195" facs="tcp:56355:104"/> from the deſign of Chriſt; who did not inſtitute this Sacrament to be a Rite, to purge Men from Accuſations, or Seal Curſes on Men, who brake their Leagues; and therefore this is not a good Example for our Church to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; nor ought the Diſſenters to deſire the ſame Liberty, till they have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Fact was not Evil. Yet if it were well done, what conſequence can they draw from it? may private Miniſters do all that the great Biſhop of the Weſt may do? Or becauſe he did take this Liberty, once upon a very Extraordinary occaſion, ought they to have it always, when there is nothing Extraordinary in the Caſe? I dare ſay, my Adverſary could not imagin, that this Pope gave his Clergy Liberty to vary this Form as they pleaſed, nor to draw this Act of his into an Example; and therefore I cannot ſee any reaſon, why he ſhould urge it.</p>

Here we ſee the old Author, (for theſe are his Words,) brings in an Irregular Fact of an Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Biſhop, which ought to be no Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent, and is no Evidence, what was the Cuſtom of the Orthodox Clergy in that Age. Again, this inſtance ſhews, that the old Form was generally uſed then, and that his not uſing it, was the True Reaſon, why the King reproved him, <hi>viz.</hi> for daring to alter the Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed Form; For the laſt Words, <hi>that none are truly Worthy,</hi> are not the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:56355:105"/> Words of the King, but of the Writer of his Life. Wherefore the uſage of that Time was, for all to Adminiſter by the ancient and Eſtabliſhed Form; and that when an Eminent Arch Biſhop preſumed to vary from it, he was ſharply reproved for it, by a Religious King, and is cenſured by an ancient Hiſtorian, as one that did not amend, but deprave the Office by this pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Correction. As for <hi>Spondanus,</hi> his ſuppoſing <hi>Leuthericus</hi> refuſed the old Form, out of a diſlike of Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation, it is wholly groundleſs; For this Form was uſed in the Roman Church, long before Tranſubſtatiation came in, and is retained in thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Churches, which have rejected that falſe Doctrin.</p>
                     <p>He tells us alſo of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi>
                        <note place="margin">

But the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian cited by him, doth not ſay he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted or altered the uſual Form; he rather ſuppoſes the Pope Firſt ſaid theſe Words, for clearing of his Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:56355:106"/> and then after thoſe terrible Words, he did receive it, probably with the Common Form. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it was, we ſay, that this Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, and perhaps unlawful Fact of a Pope on that occaſion, is no Evidence of the Cuſtom of that Age; nor is it to be alledged to juſtifie any private Miniſters taking Liberty to vary the Forms as he pleaſe: Beſides, we ſee that in this Corrupt Age, the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment came to be uſed for a Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Purgation, as in this Caſe; And in confirming ſecular Leagues, as in the next; and it is no great wonder, if when they uſed the Euchariſt to new purpoſes, they were forced to invent new Forms, as in his next Inſtance, <hi>Pope</hi> Paſcal <hi>the Second did, when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered the Sacrament to the Emperor,</hi> Hen. 5th, <hi>as a Confirmation of the Peace and League then made between them</hi>

                        </note>. Now if this matter of Fact be true, it is nothing to our Queſtion, which is about the Forms commonly uſed in Divine Service: As for odd and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Caſes, and eſpecially when the Ordinances of Chriſt were proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted to ſecular Ends and Purpoſes,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:56355:106"/> they ought not to be alledged in an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry about the Cuſtom of thoſe Ages, which all grant, was to Pray, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter the Sacraments by preſcribed and impoſed Forms; and no Liberty was allowed to any, in the leaſt, to vary from them: And thoſe who did vary, were either ſo great as to believe themſelves above Rules, or ſo irregular as to be cenſured for it; wherefore theſe few Caſes do not at all prove, that the Clergy had, or ought to have a Liberty to vary from the preſcribed and eſtabliſhed Forms, in the Ordinary Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God.</p>
                     <p>I find nothing more in my Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary out of Antiquity; and had he not ſtarted theſe trifling Objections, I ſhould not have deſcended ſo low; but ſince his Fancy for a bad Cauſe, puts him upon theſe poor ſhifts, I was not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to leave any thing, that might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſe a common Reader: But now as to theſe later Ages, the Point is clear, certain and undeniable, that Liturgies were every where impoſed, and no Church permitted its own Clergy, to vary from their own way: It is true, many Corruptions and Superſtitions in
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:56355:107"/> theſe Ages, crept into the Liturgies of all Churches; but they grafted ſtill upon the old Stock, kept the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive way of Praying; Yea, retained ſo many of the ancient and pure Forms, as do frequently confute divers of theſe Corruptions and Innovations. So that it is no difficult thing to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove many of the Romiſh Modern Opinions, by ſome parts of their anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Miſſals; but that is not my buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs: It is ſufficient to my purpoſe, that I have made it Evident, there were preſcribed Forms, uſed in the public Service, even from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Chriſtianity, and that the way of Serving God by Liturgies, was the Practice of all Regular Churches, and had the Approbation of all Eminent Fathers, and of very many Councils all along in every Century, ſince the time of the Apoſtles, and from the beginning of ſetling Chriſtianity.</p>

                     <p>THERE are ſome things relating to the Antiquity of Preſcribed Forms and Liturgies, which are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed up and down my Adverſary's Book, and would not eaſily be brought under the order of Time in the Hiſtory; and yet muſt be conſidered, that no Scruple may remain concerning this great Truth: And though ſome of theſe have been briefly examined before, yet we will here put them together, and give a fuller Anſwer to all that looks like an Objection.</p>
                     <p n="1">§. 1. Firſt, He thinks to diſprove the ancient uſe of Preſcribed Forms, by affirming, That of old they had no more, <hi>but a certain Order, wherein divers Churches agreed, to adminiſter the ſeveral Parts of Worſhip, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the Severals in the Sacrament, ſo as each had its known and fixed place:</hi>
                        <pb n="202" facs="tcp:56355:108"/> This he finds in many Fathers, and he ſaith, the 19th Canon of <hi>Laodicea, An.</hi> 365. was a Rule for this Order<note n="(f)" place="margin">Diſc. of Lit. pag. 4, &amp; 5.</note>, which elſewhere he makes to be no more than a <hi>Rubric</hi> or a <hi>Directory</hi>
                        <note n="(g)" place="margin">Ib. pag. 174.</note>. But this ſhould have been proved, not only by the word <hi>Ordo,</hi> (which we have ſhewed ſignifies a <hi>Liturgy,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining not only the Method, but the very Forms themſelves); He ſhould have produced ſome ſuch ancient Rubric or Directory, which had nothing but the Method of the ſeveral Parts of Divine-Service without any Forms. For we have produced <hi>Liturgies,</hi> at leaſt as ancient as that Canon of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> viz. That of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and that in the <hi>Apoſtolical Conſtitutions,</hi> having all the Forms at large; and if he cannot ſhew one of theſe Directories, he only dreams of ſuch a thing. Now though it be hard to make out a Negative, yet we may go far to prove there was no ſuch thing, diſtinct from a Liturgy: For theſe Severals in the Sacrament, were <hi>Prayers, Interceſſions, Giving of Thanks, Prefaces, Hymns,</hi> and the like: Now theſe muſt be called by ſome diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Names in this pretended Rubric;
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:56355:108"/> and that they could not well be, unleſs they were Forms: Now if the <hi>Severals</hi> were all Forms, as the <hi>Prefaces</hi> and <hi>Hymns</hi> certainly were, then they might have proper Names for each of them, and might eaſily deſcribe them by ſome of the firſt words; as, <hi>Our Father, Lord have mercy, Lift up your Hearts, &amp;c.</hi> and then if the Forms were known by thoſe ſhort Names, that makes this Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bric become a ſhorter Liturgy. Beſides, He tells us, <hi>This Order was certain, and agreed on by ſeveral Churches, and made ſome kind of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity among them in praying for the ſame things.</hi> But it is hard to conceive, how Extempore Prayers could be agreed on by diſtant Churches, to be uſed in one certain Order; or how this agreement could produce Uniformity, if the Words of the Prayers every where differed, and the Phraſes in the ſame place daily varied: No Canons of Councils, not written Rule, nor <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, can ſuffice to make an Uniformity out of ſuch diverſity. He finds but one Canon till the beginning of the Sixth Age, to direct this Order, <hi>viz.</hi> the 19th Canon of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> and that is a very ſhort one, which only
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:56355:109"/> mentions Six Prayers, as known by their proper Names; therefore to be ſure, that Canon was not all the Rule the Church had for this Agreement and Uniformity: And for the <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, it was that which the Deacon lifted up at the end of every Collect, when the Biſhop or Prieſt came to ſay, <hi>Through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord;</hi> to give Notice to the People, to ſay <hi>Amen,</hi> or to make ſome Reſponſe: And ſometimes to call them off from their Knees, to joyn in Hymns, or the like; which ſuppoſes known Forms, when ſo ſlight a Signal ſerved a great Congregation, to make them ready for all Parts of the Service, in which they had any ſhare: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there muſt be more, to make this Uniformity in diſtant Churches, and in very large Congregations, and that was Preſcribed Liturgies, which we have made out, to be much elder than his imaginary Rubric or Directory. But for once let us ſuppoſe, That they had in thoſe Early Ages no more than ſome Canons or Written Rubric, preſcribing and enjoyning the certain Order of the ſeveral Parts of Worſhip, and this ſo exact, as to make divers Churches agree
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:56355:109"/> to pray for the ſame things, and in the ſame Method; Would not this be as much an abridgment of the Liberty which is claimed, and a ſtinting of the Spirit, as if the Words were preſcribed? If Miniſters then had the Gift of Prayer, could not that one Spirit which inſpired them, teach them the Order and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, as well as the Words and Phraſes? Would not this Gift have made them as Uniform, as Written Canons or Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brics, and rendred a <hi>Directory</hi> as need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs as a <hi>Liturgy?</hi> It muſt be ſo, unleſs my Adverſary will ſay, the only uſe of the Spirit is to furniſh Men with Phraſes and Expreſſions in Prayer; but that he cannot ſay (without contradicting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and blaſpheming the Spirit) becauſe he ſaith, <hi>God minds not ſo much the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, as the inward Affections</hi>
                        <note n="(h)" place="margin">Diſc. of Lit. pag. 132.</note>; and proves this by a Set of Golden-Sayings out of the Fathers<note n="(i)" place="margin">Ibid. pag. 50.</note>: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at this rate, the Gift of Prayer would only enable Men for that part of our Prayer, which God doth not much mind: So that this imaginary Order of his, deviſed to protect the Gift of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Extempore, overthrows it as much as a Common-Prayer-Book; And if he
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:56355:110"/> could make it out, Wiſe Men could not but ſee, That ſo ſoon as there was need, to agree upon his ſort of Order, and to write down the Method and the Things to be prayed for, ſo ſoon the Gif of Prayer was ceaſed, and ſo ſoon there was need alſo to agree upon the Words in which theſe Things ſhould be asked, if they would have any ſolid Agreement or Uniformity between di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Churches.</p>
                     <p n="2">§. 2. He Argues, <hi>There were no Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies in the firſt Four or Five Ages at leaſt, becauſe no Writers of that Time have any ſuch Phraſe, as</hi> Reading of Prayers, <hi>though they do ſpeak of Reading the Leſſons and the Paſſions of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs</hi>

Though I muſt alſo note, that there is not one of his Quotations brought, to prove this to be the Poſture of Prayer, which relate to the Prieſt who did Officiate, they all relate to the whole Congregation, to the Chriſtian People; and I hope their looking upwards frequently will not be allowed for a good Proof, that they (much leſs that the Prieſt) never looked on a Book of Prayers, or read any preſcribed Forms of Prayers or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſes: And for the Presbyters and Deacons, which (he ſays) could not Read (if there were any ſuch) no doubt they got their Office by Heart; for ſuch Men (he grants) were not fit to make Extempore Prayers.</p>

Experience confutes this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Reflection, becauſe many Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men do read the Common-Prayer with as much ſpirit and life, and as true Devotion, as any of his Friends ſay their Extempore Prayers; and I am
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:56355:113"/> ſure, their Tautologies, Incoherences, and tedious length, tyre a Judicious Hearer, much more than a well-read and acurate Form can do. As for <hi>Pliny,</hi> his Oration was a Form, compoſed with great Art, and committed to Memory before it was firſt ſpoken, and was deſigned to work upon the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a Croud of Men in a Secular Court, and in a Temporal Cauſe; and in that Caſe even Theatrical Geſtures, and the Artificial Acting of it, were apt to move the Auditory, more than the bare Reading it in a private Room to a few Friends<note place="margin">

But what is this to the Caſe of Prayers? <hi>Pliny</hi> durſt not have come before that Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory with an Extempore Harangue, ſuch as our Diſſenters dare come into the preſence of God and a great Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation with: He deſigned no more by his Action, but only to work upon the Frailties of Men; but our Adverſaries (I hope) will not own, That their only deſign in Prayer, is, to move the Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of their Hearers, by Tone, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, Noiſe, and Fluency. We who uſe Forms, as <hi>Pliny</hi> did, and generally have them by Heart, as he had, can
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:56355:113"/> repeat them as vigorouſly as he did the firſt time, and thereby do keep all pious Men in our Congregations very attentive. But ſtill we remember, we ſpeak to the Moſt High God, before whom our Words ought to be well weighed, and our Deſires properly expreſſed; becauſe he is not wrought upon by Noiſe and Action, as ſilly Men and Women are. If our Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be ſincere and hearty, prudently Worded in proper Phraſes, and repeated with new Devotion every day; the God we pray to, likes them no worſe for being daily in the ſame Words: And <hi>Pliny</hi> could not have <hi>wondred</hi> at us, for Reading daily the ſame Forms of Prayer; for He, and all the Prieſts of his Religion, prayed ſo to their Gods, and did not believe the Deities affected Change and Variety, or were moved with Geſticulations and Tones; Nor would that Judicious Heathen have been ſo weak, as to compare his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Orations, to the Prayers he offered up to his Gods.

And this might be expounded of Books of Offices, as well as Bibles; but ſuppoſe we grant, this Catalogue here mentioned to be the Canon of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, agreed on by the Church; and ſo the Books he ſent for, were only the Canonical Books of Scripture: His in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, that the Churches in <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>'s Time, had no other Book, will by no means follow: <hi>Euſebius</hi> lived in <hi>Palaeſtine,</hi> where the Scriptures were firſt written and beſt underſtood, and there the beſt Copies were to be had; and <hi>Euſebius</hi> who lived there, was the fitteſt Judge of them; therefore <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> ſent thither, and to him, perhaps for no more but Bibles; Not becauſe Churches were furniſhed then with no other Books, but becauſe we know, <hi>Conſtantine</hi> had Prayer-Books at home, and could get acurate Copies of the Service, writ out at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and

Thirdly, The Council of <hi>Carthage</hi> alſo doth mention a Book of the Goſpels, held over the Biſhops Head, a Book of Exorciſms to be given to the Exorciſt, and a Book of Leſſons to be delivered to the Reader, at their Ordination: But doth not mention the Service-Book, delivered to any that entred into Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders<note n="(k)" place="margin">Concil. 4. <hi>Carthag.</hi> can. 1. 7, 8.</note>. But it is too much from thence to conclude, there was no Service-Book there in the year [498]; becauſe we have proved by many Teſtimonies, which are Poſitive, that they had preſcribed Prayers there long before. And he may as well argue, that we have no Common-Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er-Book in <hi>England,</hi> ſince it is not delivered either to any Biſhop, Prieſt, or Deacon, at their Ordination, that is, there is no more done here, than was there; and yet, both we have, and they had a Book of Offices for all that; <hi>Optatus,</hi> S. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> and others before cited, do fully atteſt it: Moreover, theſe Books of Exorciſms, were Forms of Prayer, and of Catechiſing, Collected out of Holy Scripture<note n="(l)" place="margin">— <gap reason="foreign">

Fourthly, As to the Perſecutors not enquiring for, or finding, or the Chriſtians delivering no other Books to them but only Bibles; I reply, the matter of Fact is not True, and therefore his Conſequence, <hi>viz. that they had no Prayer-Books then,</hi> is falſe. Indeed the Bible was the moſt Eminent of all the Chriſtian Books, and the Foundation of their Faith, their Worſhip and their Manners: And in thoſe Ages, the Bible was in all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians Hands, the People Read it at Home; whereas the Liturgy was only in the Prieſts Hands; and upon the Notion they had of the neceſſity of concealing Myſteries from Pagans, was kept very cloſe. By which means, no doubt, Bibles were oftner found by the Perſecutors, and better known to them than the Book of Offices, the <hi>Dyptics,</hi> the Book of Exorciſms, the Book of Anthems written and compoſed to the Honour of Chriſt. Yet we are ſure
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:56355:118"/> they had theſe Books then, though they are rarely or never mentioned ſingl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Yea, from theſe and other inſtances, we firmly prove, that there muſt be Liturgies in thoſe Ages, in written Forms and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain words; which were generally own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be of great Antiquity and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, at the time when they were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in Controverſies of Faith; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Extempore Prayers cannot be cited at all; and Novel Inventions muſt have been quoted to little purpoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt obſtinate Hereticks, who openly oppoſed the Faith of the Church. But ſome perhaps may wonder, there are not more paſſages cited in the three firſt Ages, againſt the Hereticks of thoſe Times, our of Liturgies. To which I anſwer. There are but very few Writers of theſe Ages; and of thoſe who did write, few of their works are come to our hands, and their Arguments are
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:56355:121"/> generally ſo obſcure, that probably they may more frequently refer to their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies, than we can eaſily obſerve; Beſides, the Church was then unſetled, and it is probable thoſe Hereticks, who oppoſed its Doctrins, would not allow its Liturgy for a competent Judge, as we ſee in <hi>Paulus Samoſatenus,</hi> who deſpiſed the Solemn Forms of Praiſe uſed at <hi>Antoch;</hi> as being made not long before his Time: and therefore the Fathers of thoſe Ages, cited not the Liturgies ſo often, as they of the Fourth and Fifth Century did; when the long and Univerſal uſe of them had given them a greater Reputation, and a firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Authority. However in the Second Century, we have ſhewed that <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> brings in ſome Hereticks, arguing from the Churches Forms<note n="(g)" place="margin">See Part. I. Chap. II. §. 3.</note>, which proves preſcribed Forms were then uſed as clearly, as if they had been cited againſt Hereticks: We have alſo proved, that <hi>Gregory Thaumaturgus</hi> made a Liturgy in the midſt of the Third Age<note n="(h)" place="margin">Ibid. Chap. III. §. 5.</note>; and by divers other Evidences, we have ſhewed there were Liturgies, in theſe firſt three Centuries; which Point be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fixed, we need not enquire nicely,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:56355:121"/> how often they were cited againſt Hereticks, who (for any thing I know) in thoſe early Times, valued a paſſage of the Liturgies then in uſe, no more than our Diſſenters do a Proof from our Common-Prayer-Book. But we ſee in the Fourth and Fifth Centuries in both which he affirms, they had no Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies, there are Quotations good ſtore out of the public Forms, which is enough to ſpoil his Cauſe.</p>
                     <p n="6">§ 6. After his <hi>Finally,</hi> Page 22th, I thought he had done Arguing; but as if he knew not how to make an end, and could not ſtop in his full Career, we heave <hi>Further,</hi> after that <hi>Finally.</hi> And now he goes on, <hi>If there were ſuch Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies, how comes it to paſs, we meet with no Intelligence of any changing them, or alterations made in them</hi>

But as if he had forgot his own Argument, he immediately tells us, he had met with Intelligence; <hi>That</hi> Paulus Samoſatenus <hi>caſt out from the Church of</hi> Antioch, <hi>thoſe Hymns or Pſalms, which were uſed to be ſung there, in honour of Chriſt, (he might have added) and made new Forms of his own.</hi> Now this made a very great
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:56355:122"/> change in the Liturgy there; becauſe wc may remember, the whole Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Worſhip in <hi>Pliny,</hi> is deſcribed by Singing Hymns to Chriſt as God; ſo that ſome think, the greateſt part of theſe Primitive Liturgies, conſiſted in theſe Hymns; and therefore, his caſting out all theſe, was chaning more than half the Liturgy: And ſince theſe Hymns were written Forms, it is very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the Prayers were ſuitable to them, and were Forms alſo. Again, my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary meets with more Intelligence, <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>Arians</hi> altered the <hi>Gloria Patri,</hi> the Form of Baptiſm, and the Univerſally received Confeſſion of Faith<note n="(k)" place="margin">Diſc. of Lit. pag. 26.</note>. Are not all theſe ancient Forms, and parts of Liturgy? And did not the Orthodox Fathers blame the <hi>Arians,</hi> for theſe bold attempts? More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, in the next Page, he finds that the <hi>Eutychians</hi> attempted to add two or three words to the <hi>Triſagion,</hi> an ancient and known Form, and a part of the Prmitive Liturgy, which the People were ſo unwilling to have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, that the very attempting it, made a Tumult at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and a Noiſe throughout the World. Why then, doth
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:56355:122"/> he pretend, he meets with no Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence? His Fallacy is this, he ſuppoſes a Liturgy, containing nothing but Forms of Prayer, (which is a meer <hi>Chimaera,</hi> a thing that never was in thoſe Ages,) and becauſe there is no mention of altering this Liturgy, but moſt of the Inſtances happen to be in Hymns and Forms of Praiſe, he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, that they never changed the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy; that is, as he expounds it, the Prayers. But in this he is miſtaken too; For the Reader may remember, how ſtifly the Clergy and People of <hi>Naeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caeſarea,</hi> oppoſed the making any change in their old Liturgy, drawn up by <hi>Gregory Thaumuturgus.</hi> He hath owned that <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> his changing the Form, by which they uſually prayed for the Biſhop before Sermon, made a very great Noiſe. And I have told him, that it is remembred how S. <hi>Baſil</hi> changed and altered divers things in S. <hi>James</hi> his Liturgy, even in the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; I have ſhewed that <hi>Theodorus</hi> of <hi>Mopſeveſtia,</hi> rejected both thoſe Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, and made a new Office for the Communion, filled with Blaſphemies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Prayers; and this in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:56355:123"/> of the Fifth Century. So there were changes and alterations both in Prayers and Praiſes, and that ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently proves they had preſcribed Forms: For Extempore and Arbitrary Prayers are daily varied, yea they are nothing elſe, but change and variety, ſo that it is impoſſible for any to obſerve any alterations in them; If the change be a thing taken notice of, and oppoſed or cenſured, it muſt be the change, or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of a known Form; and ſince ſuch changes are noted, and were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in thoſe Ages, it evidently fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, they did uſe Forms, and no Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempore Prayers or Praiſes. And we may note by the way, that the <hi>Arians</hi> and other Hereticks, did allow Chriſt to be our Mediator, and made Prayers to God the Father in his Name, which was the way of all ancient Liturgies: ſo that they had not ſo much Quarrel to that part of Liturgy, which was <hi>Petitionary</hi> or <hi>Deprecatory,</hi> as they had to the <hi>Laudatory</hi> parts, where they ſet out our Saviour, in the glory of his Divinity, and paid direct Worſhip to him; and for this reaſon, we meet with more attempts upon the Praiſes, than
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:56355:123"/> the Prayers. As for <hi>Maldonate</hi>'s Saying, <hi>That ſuch as changed Religion, did alſo change the Prayers, and every Hereſie invented its own Prayers;</hi> which my Adverſary cites <hi>pag.</hi> 25. He ſpeaks only by gueſs, for if ever any old Hereſie had any peculiar Forms of Prayer, the Fathers long ſince burnt and deſtroyed them in a pious Zeal againſt their Errors: So that there are no Footſteps of them remaining, no nor any mention of the thing (that I can now remember) excepting the afore-mentioned Inſtance of that Heretick, <hi>Theodorus</hi> of <hi>Mopſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtia,</hi> who made a New Liturgy: And the Arian <hi>Goths,</hi> who (as we have ſhewed) had ſo corrupted the Primitive Orthodox Liturgy, that <hi>Leander</hi> and <hi>Iſidore</hi> had very great Trouble to Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect thoſe Errors, and bring the People to change their Heretical for Orthodox Forms: But both the <hi>Neſtorian</hi> and <hi>Arian</hi> Liturgies are long ſince aboliſhed, and no Memory remains of them, but only that once there were ſuch things. To conclude, There is intelligence of many Alterations made, or attempted to be made, either in whole Liturgies, or in eminent parts of them, even in
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:56355:124"/> the firſt Four or Five Centuries, and thoſe Changes were noted, oppoſed and cenſured: Which ſhews, their Service could not be then in the Extempore, or Arbitrary way, becauſe none could blame any Man for changing <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Praiſes,</hi> if the Church gave Liberty to every Miniſter to vary every day, if he pleaſed, as my Adverſary vainly ſuppoſes. This obſervation of, and oppoſition to Changes, is an undeniable Proof of known and preſcribed Forms, that had been long and conſtantly uſed.</p>

<pb n="237" facs="tcp:56355:125"/> this be ſo (and his Quotations gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally fall within this Period) then for all this doughty Argument, the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans might have Written Liturgies for Three hundred years or more at the firſt, ſince they did not endeavour in thoſe firſt and beſt Times, to conceal their Myſteries, as theſe Men think: Therefore we may have Precedents of preſcribed Forms in the firſt Ages, though all this were true.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Their calling the Sacraments <hi>Myſteries,</hi> did not hinder them from Adminiſtring them in an audible Voice before the Faithful every day; and therefore this doth not prove, That they durſt not commit them to Writing; for daily reading or ſpeaking theſe Words in public with ſo loud a Voice, that all the Faithful might hear and anſwer, was much more a publiſhing them, than Writing them in Books committed to the cuſtody of the Clergy: So that all that Margen which he heaps up<note n="(u)" place="margin">Diſc. of Lit. pag. 29.</note>, only proves. That they concealed them from the Unbaptized, who were turned out when theſe Myſteries began, as well as kept from ſeeing the Books, and ſo remained ignorant of the Solemn Words;
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:56355:126"/> but the Faithful were ſo well acquainted with the very Phraſes and Expreſſions, that if the leaſt hint were but given them in a Sermon before a promiſcuous Auditory, it put them in mind of that Paſſage in the Offices which the Preacher hinted at: Which undeniably proves, they were known and uſual Forms; and being ſuch, they muſt of neceſſity be written down, otherwiſe ſuch Variations would have been made, that no Appeal could have been made to the Faithful, concerning any part of the Office; becauſe no Extempore Man now can appeal to his Congregation for his Words or Phraſes, uſed ſome time before: Therefore they were My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries only with reſpect to the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>initiated, but well-known Forms to the Faithful, and written down to prevent all Variation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As to the tedious Proofs of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> Secrecy<note n="(w)" place="margin">Diſc. of Lit. pag. 30, 31, 32, &amp; 33.</note>, I have noted, that he owns they writ down theſe Myſteries; and <hi>pag.</hi> 32. he ſaith, <hi>That the</hi> Romans <hi>had a Book of their public Rites as old as King</hi> Tarquin<hi>'s Time;</hi> and that <hi>Valerius Max.</hi> mentions one, <hi>who was puniſhed for letting an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:56355:126"/> Perſon Tranſcribe it:</hi> Which ſhews, how impertinent all theſe Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations are to prove his Point; which is, That Myſteries muſt not at all be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Writing. Indeed, fearing this Conſequence, he adds in the next Page, 33. <hi>If they did commit them to Writing, it was in ſuch a Character, as none of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ninitiated underſtood:</hi> But then he makes out nothing, but that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> deſcribed their Myſteries in ſuch unintelligible <hi>Hieroglyphicks;</hi> which doth not prove, that either <hi>Greeks</hi> or <hi>Romans</hi> writ them in ſuch Figures; much leſs doth it ſhew, that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians uſed any <hi>Hieroglyphicks,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal their Myſteries; and therefore there is no reaſon, to argue from that Cuſtom peculiar to Pagan <hi>Egypt,</hi> as if we might learn the Chriſtian Uſage from thence.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The excluding the <hi>Catecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens</hi> from hearing the Prayers, and refuſing to recite any Phraſes of them in a Sermon made to a promiſcuous Auditory, which he ſpeaks of<note n="(x)" place="margin">Diſc. of Lit. pag. 35, 36.</note>, are very good Arguments, That theſe Offices were celebrated by preſcribed Forms; which Words had they been
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:56355:127"/> ſuffered daily to hear in the Church, when the Adminiſtration was perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or had often heard them in Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, they might eaſily learn and remember them. And it was, becauſe they were preſcribed, conſtant, inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable Forms, that they durſt neither let them ſtay in the Church when they repeated them, nor openly mention them in a Sermon. Had they Officiated variouſly, and in his Extempore way, they might have ſtood by for Seven years, and heard the Sermons, in which ſome part of them was referred to; and there had been no danger of their learning them. And ſince we ſee the Heathens did write down their Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and make them known to the Initiated, the Chriſtians might do ſo alſo, and yet keep them ſecret enough from the Unconverted, or Unbaptized; for they might as well keep them from ſeeing their Books of Myſteries, as to turn them out of the Church, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their hearing them. And his inſtance of the Creed, <hi>pag.</hi> 37. proves this; for the Creed was written down and expounded in the Time of <hi>Cyril</hi> and <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> and yet then, and long
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:56355:127"/> after, it was kept ſecret from the <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chumens,</hi> till ſome ſmall time before the Day of their Baptiſm; therefore every thing that was written was not publiſhed to the Uninitiated.</p>

<pb n="243" facs="tcp:56355:128"/> began ſooner, there is no doubt, but the Faithful were taught to be as reſolute not to publiſh their Myſteries, as they were not to deny their Faith; ſo that there was no danger of their being publiſhed by Tortures. Finally, If the People had all their Reſponſes, and their part of the Liturgy by Heart (as they might eaſily have) there was no need of Writing out the Forms for them, as he inſinuates, <hi>pag.</hi> 44. and ſo, that could be no occaſion of publiſhing the Forms to Unbelievers. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, There is nothing in this tedious Ramble of my Adverſaries for 16 Pages together, which doth in the leaſt prove, That the Chriſtian Myſteries were not celebrated by Written Forms; and therefore there is nothing in it to his purpoſe, but on the contrary much of it tends to prove, <hi>That the Divine-Service was then performed by Preſcribed Forms.</hi>

<pb n="246" facs="tcp:56355:130"/> Majeſty, and the Care and Caution to be uſed in ſpeaking to Him, before whom Angels voil their Faces; their Sermons were only ſpoken to mortal Men, but their Prayers addreſſed to a Glorious, Immortal God; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they took freedom in the one, but durſt not in the other: There they uſed holy and known Forms, not out of neceſſity, but choice; which ſhews their Judgment was, That Forms were the beſt way of Serving God, in public eſpecially; and though they were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Qualified than our Diſſenting Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren for Extempore Praying, they rejected that Method. All this we have reaſon to believe from the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Silence, concerning Extempore Prayer in all theſe Ages, wherein we ſee, they do obſerve there was an uſe of Extempore Preaching; and if this Gift of Praying on the ſudden had been ſo admirable a thing, and ſo neceſſary, to qualifie a Man for the Miniſtry, 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible but there would have been ſome memorial of the uſe of it, and ſome of the Fathers muſt have been commended for excelling in it; but no ſuch matter appearing, while yet there are plain

<pb n="249" facs="tcp:56355:131"/> Nor is this difference of the Greek and Latin Church, any ground for the liberty which my Adverſary pleads for, <hi>viz.</hi> the liberty for private Miniſters to vary the Forms of their own Church, as they pleaſe: For no Biſhop or Prieſt in the Latin Church was allowed to uſe the Third Perſon, nor did any in the Greek Church uſe the Firſt; ſo that every Clergy-man was bound to uſe the Forms preſcribed in his own Country, and the Church of <hi>England</hi> doth not impoſe any more. Then as for his ridiculous ugring of the Fathers uſing, <hi>Tingo &amp; Mergo, &amp;c.</hi> for <hi>Baptizo,</hi> we muſt note, that not one of his Inſtances, are any account of the words uſed in the Actual Adminiſtration of Baptiſm; he cannot ſhew they uſed any word but <hi>[Baptizo]</hi> then: But his Proofs are out of the Fathers occaſional Diſcourſes concerning Baptiſm, which they deſcribe in their own words and phraſes as it happens; even as we call this holy Action, <hi>Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> or <hi>Sprinkling the Child,</hi> as well as <hi>Baptizing,</hi> in our ordinary Diſcourſe: But would any Man, whoſe Head were right, infer from thence, That our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, in the Act of Baptizing, took
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:56355:132"/> liberty to ſay, <hi>I Chriſten thee,</hi> or, <hi>I Sprinkle thee, &amp;c.</hi> I am aſhamed to confute ſuch mean Sophiſtry! yet muſt add, That our Lord neither ſpake Latin nor Greek, but a Language which was Hebrew mixt with Syriack; and it is ſtrange, when His Words are to be turned into any other Language in our common Diſcourſe, that we may not tranſlate them by any ſignificant Words: But this Liberty in ordinary Converſe or Writing, is no manner of proof, That the private Miniſters of any Church, may vary the Words uſed in their Offices, when they Adminiſter the Sacrament of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> But he goes on to prove this liberty of Variation, by the Fathers ſometimes ſaying, <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="251" facs="tcp:56355:132"/> Our Church Baptizes Men into the Faith of the Holy Trinity, or in the Name of the Father the Creator, the Son the Redeemer, and the Holy Ghoſt the Sanctifier of all Men: This would not prove, that this Preacher or Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſt did not uſe the Words of the Churches Form when he actually Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, nor ſhew that we have here no preſcribed Form of Baptiſm. This is meer trifling.

Again, he notes, <hi>Though Baptiſm ſhould be valid, though the words of this Form were altered; Yet, the old Form ought not to be innovated or changed, at every Mans pleaſure. And if Chriſt had not tied us to a certain Form of Words; Yet it is much better to retain the old Form, which all Agree to be certainly right; but it is diſputable and uncertain, whether any other Form be ſo or no: And ſurely, certain things are much to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before uncertain</hi>

Now though <hi>Grotius</hi> here be not ſo juſt, (perhaps) as he ought to be, to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity of Creeds, and being a Modern Author, his Affirmation in this weighs no more, than his Inſtances prove: Yet, I will wave that Diſpute, and for the preſent admit what he ſaith were true, and then make Parallel between Creeds and Liturgies. And in his Firſt Inference, he only ſaith, <hi>That when the Ancients uſe various ways of expreſſing their Faith, they do not refer to one
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:56355:135"/> certain Form of Words, received in all places, but only to the force and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Interrogations:</hi> Which ſhews, <hi>Grotius</hi> did not think (as my Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary groſly doth,) That every one of the Ancients in the places cited, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to repeat the very Form of the Creed; but only to ſhew the main Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrins of it, which in theſe occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Diſcourſes, is all that we can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect: And therefore the variety of expreſſions doth not prove, there was not one Form of Creed, but that theſe Fathers, in theſe places do not refer to that Form. Yet, Secondly, Theſe Fathers all lived within 250 years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſt; and if we grant to <hi>Grotius<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> that then there was not one Form of Creed, every where received, we may allow the Parallel with Liturgies, and ſuppoſe that in <hi>Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Novatian</hi>'s Time, and ſo upwards to <hi>Tertullian, Irenaeus</hi> and <hi>Juſtin</hi> Martyr, there was not one Form of Liturgy, every where received; yet for all this Liturgies might be uſed and received before the year 300, that is, before the quiet ſettlement of the Chriſtian Church 1400 years ago, and above 200 years before my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:56355:136"/> allows them to have come in. And this alſo is all that can be inferred from his words, in the ſecond Paſſage, viz.

                     <p>In the next Page, in the Margen he grants, <hi>the Creeds had more ſtated Forms in the Fourth Century; though even then, the Creeds of ſeveral Cities, in the ſame Country, were not <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niform, and he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in</hi> Rome, Aquileia, <hi>and</hi> Raven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na <hi>in</hi> Italy, <hi>referring us to</hi> Voſſius <hi>and

This is his way of Arguing upon a falſe Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, That the Creed was not in a Set Form in the Firſt Ages: Wherefore ſince it appears by his own Authors, that it was in a Set Form, in or before the Third Century, he muſt allow this to be a firm Argument againſt him.</p>
                     <p>It is nothing to my Queſtion, to enter into the Controverſie, Whether the Apoſtles themſelves made that Creed which goes under their Name: But after I have conſidered all that <hi>Voſſius, &amp;c.</hi> have ſaid in this Matter, I am verily perſuaded, That the Apoſtles themſelves did make one Form of Faith at firſt, but did not commit it to writing, becauſe it was to be taught orally to
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:56355:138"/> every Chriſtian at his Baptiſm, and kept as the Cognizance, to diſtinguiſh between Hereticks and true Believers: and the likeneſs of all the ancient Forms to one another, ſhews, they had one and the ſame Original at firſt, and were derived from the firſt Planters of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity: As for the variety between theſe ancient Forms in ſeveral Churches, it was the natural and neceſſary effect of delivering it Orally, which in diſtant Countries, and in tract of Time by paſſing through divers hands, muſt needs produce ſome ſmall difference in the Order and Words; and that ſhews, That Oral Tradition is not ſo ſafe a way to convey Articles of Faith, as Writing; and though the Apoſtles had left the Scripture to be a ſtanding Rule, to ſecure the Creed from any dangerous Corruption, yet it was neceſſary to have this ſhort Form beſides, to teach the Candidates for Baptiſm: But if the Reader deſire to ſee this more fully proved, I refer him to a Learned Book writ by a very Worthy Author, Mr. <hi>G. Aſhwell, Wherein (both by Arguments and evidence of Antiquity) it is ſtrongly and clearly made out, that this Creed was
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:56355:139"/> made by the Apoſtles themſelves</hi>

To conclude, The Apoſtles ſhewed the way of making Forms of the things to be believed, and if the Parallel hold between Creeds and Liturgies, then we have reaſon to believe they firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Forms alſo, for the things to be asked of God in Prayer, and to be
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:56355:140"/> ſpoken to his Honour in Praiſes: Which firſt and Apoſtolical Forms are the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and ground of all the ſeveral Liturgies in great and eminent Churches, which (like their Creeds) agree in the main Eſſential parts, and have ſo much likeneſs, as to perſuade us they all came from one Original Form at firſt; but tract of Time and diſtacne of Place cauſed ſome differences in the Order and Phraſes in diſtant Churches: But ſo, that all the Members of every great Church were obliged to learn the Creed of that Church where they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their Baptiſm, and alſo to uſe the Forms of that ſame Church, in whoſe Communion they lived. And this may ſuffice for his Conſequences drawn from the Primitive Creeds; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is nothing to our purpoſe when they came to be uſed firſt in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion Office, foraſmuch as he grants they were uſed in the Office of Baptiſm from the beginning.</p>

He concludes this Set of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments by a large and tedious digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, about the Variety uſed in the Form of Renouncing the Devil in Baptiſm; and here again he fills his Margen with the Names of near twenty Ancients, who ſpeak of this Form of Renuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in different Words, by which he hopes to prove, <hi>That this Form was arbitrary, ſince not only divers Churches differed therein, but the Authors who lived in the ſame Church, yea, the ſame Author in ſeveral places of his Works expreſſes it variouſly.</hi> And then comes his Inference, <hi>That if they were not limited to a Set Form of Words in this Sentence, none can believe they were, or would have ſuffered themſelves to be confined to an invariable Form of Words in Praying at Baptiſm</hi>

Now, if we ſhould grant his Conſequence did fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low from theſe Premiſſes, then we muſt expect at leaſt, that the Premiſſes ſhall be fully proved; but we ſhall ſhew, that he hath not made them out ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently: For firſt, the greater part of his Authors do not pretend to recite the Form, but are only applying the
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:56355:141"/> Duty, in occaſional Diſcourſes; for which I need no other Evidence, but to deſire the Reader to conſult the Places he produceth out of <hi>Origen, Ephrem Syrus, S. Baſil, Cyril</hi> of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria, Pſeudo Dionyſius, Juſtinian, Optatus, S. Cyprian, S. Auguſtin</hi> in the two later places, and <hi>S. Hierom:</hi> Theſe Fathers in Homilies and practical Diſcourſes ſpeak of the thing, and preſs the Obligation; but do not pretend to repeat the words; they expreſs them in their own Phraſes, and therefore no wonder if they differ. Secondly, Many of theſe Witneſſes do not ſpeak of the whole Renunciation, but ſome of the Renouncing the Devil only, others only of Renouncing the World, as the Subject, upon which they were treating, required; and it is ſtrange that he ſhould cite theſe Authors, to make out a difference in the whole Form, when one ſpeaks of one part of it, and another Author treats of another part. Thirdly, Moſt of theſe Authors not only lived in ſeveral Ages, but belonged to ſeveral diſtant Countries, and were Members of Churches which had ſome difference in the Phraſes and Order of their whole Liturgy; and
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:56355:141"/> therefore their differing in the Words or Syllables of this Renunciation, doth not prove they had no Set Forms of Prayer in any Church; but only that ſeveral great Churches had ſome Variety in their Forms, which we freely grant, and it cannot hurt our Cauſe, ſince all were limited to uſe the Forms of their own Church: Thus <hi>Origen</hi> belonged to <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria, Conſtantine</hi>'s Edict was forged at <hi>Rome, Cyril</hi> was of <hi>Palaeſtina, Baſil</hi> of <hi>Cappadocia, Salvian</hi> of <hi>France, Pſeudo-Dionyſius</hi> of <hi>Laodicea, Clemens</hi> of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch, Juſtinian</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople, Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> of <hi>Africa,</hi> and <hi>S. Ambroſe</hi> of <hi>Milan.</hi> Now we have proved, that there was a Variety between the Liturgies of theſe diſtant Churches in many parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, and therefore it is not ſtrange they ſhould differ in expreſſing the Syllables of the Renunciation, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing every one of them had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating the Form of his own Church. Yet, Fourthly, Thoſe of the ſame Country, and eſpcially thoſe of the ſame Church do either agree, or come as near one another, as can be expected from Men, who are rather deſcribing than repeating the Form. Thus <hi>Ephrem-Syrus</hi>
                        <pb n="270" facs="tcp:56355:142"/> and <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> do agree exactly, both of them, no doubt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring to the Form uſed in <hi>Palaeſtina: Salvian</hi> twice mentions this Form in the ſame words, referring to the Liturgy of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church; and <hi>S. Chryſoſtom</hi> differs very little from <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> becauſe both had reſpect to the <hi>Conſtantinopolitan</hi> Form, and that of <hi>Antioch</hi> related in the <hi>Conſtitutions,</hi> is very near it: So <hi>Tertullian</hi> and S. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> where they ſpeak cloſely, do exactly agree in the <hi>African</hi> Form. And it is very probable, that <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s Edict refers to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Form, <hi>Baſil</hi> to that of <hi>Naeocoeſarea,</hi> and S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> to that of <hi>Milan.</hi> Now if each of theſe great Churches had a certain Form, to the uſe of which all that belonged to it were obliged, then probably they had alſo ſuch a Form for other Prayers. And, Fifthly, it is very plain that every great Church had ſuch a Form, becauſe the Fathers do very often charge thoſe who were Baptized, to remember the very words in which they made this Renunciation; ſo doth <hi>S. Ambroſe</hi>

<pb n="271" facs="tcp:56355:142"/> Now this Charge had been ridiculous, and had required an Impoſſibility, if the Words were arbitrary, and every one of them had made the Renuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in a different Form of Words. I conclude therefore, That every Great Church had one certain Form, and all of them were ſo like, that they muſt come from one Original at firſt; and it was only length of Time, and diſtance of Place, that had made the ſmall Variations between the Forms of ſeveral eminent Churches: Which alſo was the Caſe of Liturgies in general, and of the whole Baptiſmal Office, as well as of this peculiar part of it. We have now done with all his Arguments of this kind, and will leave the Reader to judge of the Modeſty and Truth of thoſe mighty Brags, which he makes of the narrow ſearch he hath made into Antiquity, and the full Anſwer he hath given to all that either he could meet with, or that others had produced on Behalf of Liturgies, whoſe Primitive Original and general Uſe is but more cleared by all his Objections againſt them.</p>

My Adverſary concludes his Book, firſt, by fixing the Period when <hi>Liturgies</hi> did come in; and, ſecondly, by a moſt odious Repreſentation of that Age: For the firſt, he concludes, <hi>That for Five hundred years after Chriſt (if not more) the ordinary way of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiping God in public Aſſemblies, was not by preſcribed Liturgies</hi>
                        <note n="(e)" place="margin">Diſc. of Lit. pag. 181.</note>. The falſhood of which Concluſion, this whole Diſcourſe hath ſufficiently diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered: And his not being able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce one clear Proof, That Extempore Prayer was the way of Worſhiping God in public in all this Period, gives me reaſon more juſtly to conclude, That for Five hundred years and more after Chriſt, that kind of Praying was not uſed in Chriſtian Aſſemblies; <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe</hi> (to uſe his own words) <hi>if there had been ſuch a Way of Praying uſed conſtantly in all Churches, for ſo long a time together, there would have been ſuch clear Evidence of it in many of the Ancients, that there might have been had as full proof thereof, as of any one thing; and eſpecially when this Author and his party have been ſearching ſo
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:56355:143"/> narrowly in Antiquity for this, and are ſenſible how much their Cauſe is concerned in it; and yet here is nothing produced that is poſitive or expreſs</hi>
                        <note n="(f)" place="margin">Diſc. of Lit. pag. 179, 180.</note>. However, let us (for once) ſuppoſe that Extempore or Arbitrary Praying was the Uſage of the Church for Five hundred years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, or more, and that then Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies began to be impoſed: This was a remarkable and mighty change in the Public Service of God, the reſtraining of a Liberty, which we muſt ſuppoſe the Chriſtian Prieſts and People had enjoyed down from the Time of the Apoſtles. Now this could not have been done in an Age wherein there were ſo many eminent Writers, and ſo many zealous Aſſertors of Apoſtolical Uſages, but it muſt have made a great noiſe in the World; ſome would have complained of and written againſt this daring Innovation, and (as our Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters count it) bold uſurpation upon Mens Conſciences, and manifeſt quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Spirit. But my Adverſary (though very quick ſighted) can find nothing of this Matter, he hath not one Quotation to this purpoſe: There is an abſolute Silence in all Authors of
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:56355:144"/> theſe Ages; none claimed this pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ancient Right, none complained that it was taken from them; nor did any ſo much as take notice of this emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and public Alteration; which undeniably proves there was no ſuch Change then made; and ſhews, that preſcribed Forms had been uſed in the foregoing Ages, and continued in this Century as they were before. My Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary hath noted what Seditions hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in divers Churches, and what Noiſe was made over all the Chriſtian World, upon a ſmall alteration in an ancient Form; and is it likely all People would be ſo quiet and ſilent, when the whole Manner of God's public Service was changed at once? When we charge the <hi>Roman</hi> Church with the novelty of her Corruptions, we prove that Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, by ſhewing, That ſuch as lived before that Corruption came in, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved or practiſed otherwiſe: That ſuch as lived when it was coming in, oppoſed it and writ againſt it; and many refuſed to ſubmit to it, after it was come in, as in the caſe of Images. But in this unjuſt Charge no ſuch thing is made out; wherefore we conclude,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:56355:144"/> That Liturgies are neither a Corruption, nor an Innovation; but the Pure and Primitive Way of the Chriſtians public Worſhip.</p>
                     <p>But, Secondly, he is ſo confident that Liturgies were brought in and impoſed about the Year 500, that he ſpends 17 Pages together (which is all the reſt of his Book) in vilifying that Age; and to this end he rakes together a mighty heap of Quotations, to expoſe the Biſhops and Clergy, and indeed all the People of thoſe Times, the deſign of which is (beſides the gratifying his Ill-will to the Sacred Order of Epiſcopacy) to ſhew, <hi>That ſince the Governours of the Church, and the whole Age, was ſo extreamly bad and degenerate, when Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies firſt were impoſed; therefore they are a Corruption, and the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of them is by no means to be approved.</hi> But he hath managed this odious Charge with ſo much Spite, and ſo many Fallacies, That though his groſs miſdating the Original of <hi>Liturgies,</hi> makes all this to be nothing to our Queſtion, yet I cannot ſhut up this Diſcourſe, till I have ſhewed, Firſt, the weakneſs of this Argument, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the Premiſſes were true; And,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:56355:145"/> Secondly, the many Fallacies and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes that appear in his managing of it, and in the Inſtances which he brings to make it out.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The Argument it ſelf is trifling, and the Reaſoning very frivolous upon Two Accounts. For,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, No wiſe Man will ſay, that every thing muſt be Evil which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun in an ill Age: No Times were worſe than thoſe wherein our Lord began to Preach the Goſpel; no People wickeder than the <hi>Jews</hi> at that Time. The Northern Nations were bloody and barbarous, cruel and perſidious to the higheſt Degree, when the Scripture was firſt Tranſlated into the <hi>Gothic</hi> Tongue: And King <hi>Alfred</hi>'s Age was extreamly Ignorant, and notoriouſly Vitious; yet then the Goſpels, and other excellent Books, were tranſlated into <hi>Saxon.</hi> The Reformation it ſelf was begun in an Age when the generality of the Clergy and Laity both were as deſtitute of Learning as they were of Vertue: But how ridiculous would he be, that ſhould diſparage the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Tranſlating of Holy Scripture, and the Goſpel it ſelf, by haranguing
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:56355:145"/> upon the Times when theſe things firſt appeared in the World? There have been many Ill things brought in even in good Times, and many Good things in bad Times; ſo that there is no Arguing from this Topic with any ſolidity or certainty; indeed, if he had proved, that theſe Evil Men brought in Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, and none but Evil Men uſed them, and ſubmitted to them; that had been ſomething to the purpoſe. Now this we might do, as to his Dear Way of Extempore Prayer: For the <hi>Directory</hi> was firſt ſet up and enjoyned here in a Time of Rebellion and Sacriledge; in a Time wherein there were more vile Hypocrites, and profligate Wretches, under the Mask of Religion, than ever were known in this Nation in any Age before; which is largely made out by very many Books then Writ, which beyond contradiction declare the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact to be true<note n="(g)" place="margin">See <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>'s <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grena,</hi> in three Parts.

                     <p>By this Table it appears, that the eldeſt of his Authors lived in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the Fourth Age, and the laſt in the middle of the Fifth; the firſt was 134 years, and the laſt 40 years before the Year 500: So that unleſs they had the Spirit of Prophccy, they could not give any account what would be the ſtate of the Church in that Age, which he deſigns to expoſe: And therefore all this is random Shot, or aimed at a wrong Mark, and can ſerve no other
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:56355:148"/> end, but only to gratifie thoſe who take pleaſure in hearing of the Ignorance or Vices of the Clergy. For if that Age, which theſe Authors deſcribe, were not the Age when Liturgies were firſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, then all this Harangue is wholly impertinent to the matter in queſtion: Only thus much perhaps we might infer from it, That if theſe Centuries which my Adverſary hath ſo blackned, were before the impoſing of Liturgies; then he (no doubt) believes there were no other Prayers uſed at that time, but ſuch as were either Arbitrary or Extempore: whence it will follow, that all theſe proud, tyrannical, ignorant, vicious, ſuperſtitious and ſcandalous Prieſts and Biſhops (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his calculation) prayed Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily and Extempore, which will be as little for the credit of his Method of Praying, as he meant it ſhould be for the honour of our Way. I have only one thing more to add, <hi>viz.</hi> That in other parts of his Book, and in a better humor, he gives a tolerable good Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the Fourth and Fifth Centuries, which he ſo groſly diſparages here; for he ſaith, <hi>Many there were excellently accompliſhed in the Fourth Age, and ſome
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:56355:149"/> till about the middle of the Fifth: So that it would be much for the Credit of Liturgies if they could be found, while there was any thing of ſuch Eminency in the Church</hi>
                        <note n="(n)" place="margin">Diſc. of Lit. pag. 155.</note>. And again a little after, <hi>Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and frequent Preaching was the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the Fourth, and part of the Fifth Age, and its ſecurity was the excellency of thoſe Biſhops, who were the lights and ornaments of thoſe Times</hi>
                        <note n="(o)" place="margin">Diſc. of Lit. p. 190.</note>. So that for ought I know, this Age was a good one, for all this long Character of its degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, and (if I had a mind) I could fill as many Pages in its commendation, as he hath done in its diſgrace; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if Liturgies had come in then, it had been no hurt, no nor any diſreputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them: However this Argument, thus managed, could not injure them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, As to his formidable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of invidious Quotations, I have taken the pains to examine them all; and beſides, that jumbling of Authors and Times, and repeating the ſame In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances twice or thrice, which is his uſual way of proceeding, I dare aſſure the Reader, there are ſome of them falſly cited, more of them miſapplied, and moſt of them impertinent; and though I
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:56355:149"/> doubt it will be a little tedious, yet I will make ſome ſhort Remarks upon them, by which it will appear, that theſe Inſtances thus cited and applied, give a worſe Character of him that produces them, than they do of the Age intended to be blackned by them.</p>

But as to the matter of Fact, we have ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Teſtimony, (for all this good Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops complaint) that there were at that time, many very Learned Men in <hi>Africa,</hi> and therefore this muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood,

And beſides, he grants
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:56355:157"/> that theſe unlearned Biſhops, were not fit to be truſted with making Extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore Prayers, and therefore it ſeems neceſſary that theſe Biſhops ſhould have Forms preſcribed, which they either Read, or got them by Heart; and if ſo, then ſuch Forms were uſed above 50 years before the Period he aſſigns. As for his laſt Inſtance of <hi>Leo</hi>'s not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting any one to be a Biſhop, unleſs he were perfect in the Pſalter; I obſerve that this Emperor intended to prevent that Scandal, which had been given by thoſe few unlearned Biſhops in former Times; and therefore would have none admitted, but ſuch as well underſtood the Pſalter, which was a great part of the Liturgy, and part of it to be Read every day among the Prayers; ſo that it is very probable, that the uſual Forms of public Prayer, were put into one Volume with the Pſalter, as our Common Prayer is at this day.

Now ſince the Learned and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Promoters of the Reformation, did ſo narrowly examine into, and ſo Unanimouſly reject all thoſe Doctrins, and Practices of the Roman Church, which did not agree to Holy Scripture and pure Antiquity; and yet none of them, did ever reckon preſcribed Forms among thoſe Corruptions, but appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and eſtabliſhed them, in thoſe Churches which they had reformed;
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:56355:159"/> we may conclude, That Set Forms of Prayers and Liturgies are ageeable to Gods Word, and to the uſage of the beſt Ages of the Church. And we have at this time, a more particular reaſon to make out this Conſent of all ſetled Proteſtant Churches, as to the uſe of preſcribed Forms: Becauſe our Adverſaries are perpetually calling upon us, to conform our ſelves to the Example of Foreign Reformed Churches; and pretending, that to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their way, will be a certain means to unite all Proteſtants, both at home and abroad. We confeſs, the end is a thing (at this Juncture) very deſirable; but that which they ſuppoſe, is ſo far from being a probable means to obtain it, That if we ſhould caſt off our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed Forms, and ſet up their Extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore and Arbitrary way of Praying, we ſhould act contrary to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the beſt Proteſtant Writers, and to the Practice of the moſt famous Proteſtant Churches every where; but by continuing the uſe of our excellent Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, and binding all our Clergy to it, we follow the advice and example of all our <hi>Siſter Churches:</hi> And can they imagin, that
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:56355:159"/> to oblige a few obſtinate and ſingular leading Men, and their Ignorant and Enthuſiaſtical followers; we will bring ſuch a reproach upon our Church, as to caſt away that Method of Praying, which is ſo conſonant to Scripture and Antiquity, and ſo agreeable to the Opinion and practice of the beſt Proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants? It would be madneſs in us to do this, and it is little leſs in them to expect it: However becauſe ſome of them are to this day, deluded with this groſs miſtake; That preſcribed Forms are ſome of the remains of Popery, and a Liturgy eſtabliſhed, is not allowed in other Proteſtant Churches; I ſhall conclude this Diſcourſe, with ſome few proofs of the Opinion, and Practice of the moſt Eminent Divines and Churches of the Reformation, both Foreign and Domeſtic; and that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation as well to Liturgies in general, as to our Liturgy in particular, when I have firſt obſerved, that the Learned and Induſtrious Monſ. <hi>Durell,</hi> hath Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected a great number of theſe Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies; ſome of which I have here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, and added others of my own obſervation, referring the Reader for

<pb n="332" facs="tcp:56355:173"/> Worſhip: And it manifeſtly appears, That the Proteſtants of the</hi> French <hi>Churches never were againſt ſuch Forms, becauſe they had a Form for Adminiſtring the Sacraments, for celebrating Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and certain other Preſcribed Prayers which none of us were allowed to recede from</hi>

I need add no more Evidence in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo plain, for this will ſhew to all, whom Intereſt and wilful Prejudice doth not blind, both that all Foreign Churches, and Eminent Writers do approve of preſcribed Forms, and that they as well as our own Reformers, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally eſteem our Liturgy, as a moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Form of Service.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore, I will now conclude with a charitable and compaſſionate Addreſs, to thoſe unhappy, but well meaning Diſſenters, who are deſignedly impoſed on by their intereſted Teachers; I doubt not but many of them, ſincerely deſire to worſhip God in the moſt acceptable
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:56355:174"/> way; and the reaſon why they ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from our Worſhip, is becauſe they have been induſtriouſly prejudiced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Forms, as a Novel Corruption, a Popiſh Superſtition, a Method of Praying contrary to Scripture, and to the Judgment and Practice, as well of the Primitive and Ancient, as of the Proteſtant and Modern Churches. But now, my Brethren, when all this is proved to be nothing elſe but Falſhood and Malice, I hope you will ſuffer your ſelves to be undeceived, and joyn with us in that way of Praying, which was uſed by the Saints in the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, enjoyned by Chriſt in the New, practiſed by all thoſe Holy Biſhops and Devout Chriſtians, who lived ever ſince the firſt ſetling of the Church, and now allowed and obſerved in all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Proteſtant Churches; And eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſince we have a Liturgy ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally approved by them all.

And poſſibly thoſe of the <hi>Authors
<pb facs="tcp:56355:184"/> Principles,</hi> (who are generally Strangers in the <hi>Fathers</hi>) may think he hath mighty Evidence of his ſide, while thoſe who are skilled in the <hi>Primitive Writers,</hi> may eaſily diſcern at firſt Reading, that his <hi>Inſtances</hi> are generally falſe, or impertinent, and his <hi>Inferences</hi> forced and fallacious. This I have ſhewed in the following Papers particularly, and ſhall only now make a few general <hi>Obſervations,</hi> to take off the Advantages which he ſeems to have by theſe numerous <hi>Allegations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, His <hi>Teſtimonies</hi> are not ſo many as they may appear to an haſty and careleſs <hi>Reader,</hi> becauſe He often repeats the ſame thing twice, yea, thrice over in ſeveral parts of his Book. Thus the ſame places of S. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> are tranſcribed often, as about correcting <hi>Prayers</hi>
                     <note n="(e)" place="margin">Diſc. of Lit. pag. 48, &amp; 113.</note>;
<pb facs="tcp:56355:184"/> about <hi>Barbariſms</hi> and <hi>Soleciſms</hi>

                     <note n="(g)" place="margin">Ib. p. 66. &amp; pag. 121.</note>: And He quotes one Paſſage in <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtine</hi>'s Epiſtles thrice<note n="(h)" place="margin">Ibid. p. 6. p. 29, &amp; 138</note>; in like manner he hath dealt with the ſame places of <hi>Juſtin, Martyr,</hi> S. <hi>Baſil, Innocentius,</hi> and almoſt all other <hi>Fathers,</hi> who he thinks have any thing which ſounds to the diſcredit of <hi>Liturgy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, His Teſtimonies are not ſo weighty as might be imagined at firſt ſight, becauſe wherever his <hi>Margen</hi> is very full, it is always to prove ſomething which no Body will deny, and which is nothing to the purpoſe: As about the Ancients delight to conceal their <hi>Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
                     <note n="(i)" place="margin">Diſc. of Lit. pag. 28, 29, 34, 35, 36, 42.</note>; about the <hi>Laying on of Hands</hi> in divers Offices<note n="(k)" place="margin">Ib. p. 51, &amp; 52.</note>; about the <hi>Variety of Expreſſions</hi> in the <hi>Fathers,</hi> who only occaſionally ſpeak

                     <note n="(m)" place="margin">Ib. p. 106, &amp; 107.</note>. Now this arguaes a great ſcarcity of <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies</hi> concerning the Public and Solemn manner of making <hi>Prayers</hi> in <hi>Chriſtian Aſſemblies,</hi> which is the only <hi>Point</hi> in queſtion.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, His Evidence is by no means clear and intelligible, and He ſeems to deſign it ſhould not ſerve to <hi>inform,</hi> but <hi>amuſe;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath jumbled all <hi>Antiquity</hi> together, and thrown it into confuſed Heaps, placing the later <hi>Fathers</hi> often before the former, and mixing the <hi>firſt, laſt,</hi> and <hi>middle Ages</hi> together, without any order or cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; yea, and citing the ſame <hi>Father</hi> in little parcels in ſundry and diſtant places of his <hi>Book:</hi> So that it is almoſt impoſſible from him to learn the true Senſe either of any Age or any Ancient Writer, becauſe
<pb facs="tcp:56355:185"/> thoſe Matters which ſhould help us to judge of this, are ſo deſignedly ſcattered and diſperſed.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, His <hi>Quotations</hi> are not faithful, for he frequently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſes the Evidence which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces, both by falſe Tranſlating divers Paſſages, and Citing them wrong: So in the Council of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage</hi> he reads, <hi>Quaſcunque</hi> for <hi>Quicunque</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:56355:186"/> Authors imperfectly, drawing a Line thus—and leaving out the moſt material Words, if they ſeem to make againſt him. So when he perverts <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> as if he ſpake of Words in <hi>Extempore Prayer,</hi> he draws a Line before — <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and applies it falſly to <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; but in <hi>Nazianzen</hi> there are three <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantives (The Throne, the Altar,</hi> and <hi>the Holy Things</hi>) in that Sentence, which he twice leaves out<note n="(q)" place="margin">Diſc. of Lit. pag. 60, &amp; pag. 77.</note>, to which <hi>Subſtantives</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">

<pb facs="tcp:56355:186"/> which a Man might expect rather from the Diſciples of <hi>Loyola,</hi> than from Perſons that pretend to Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of Conſcience.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Whereas he often ſaith, <hi>He hath Anſwered all the Places of the Ancients, which either others had alledged, or He in his diligent ſearch of Antiquity had met with, which ſeem to make for Liturgies</hi>
                     <note n="(s)" place="margin">Diſc. of Lit. p. 179, &amp; alibi.</note>; I doubt not but to make it appear, that he hath not only omitted, but induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly concealed ſome Hundreds of Proofs for <hi>Liturgies,</hi> which I ſhall produce in my Anſwer; and by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring that clear Evidence with the ſlight Teſtimonies which he produces to confute, it will appear to every Intelligent Reader, that he reſolved to keep all Teſtimonies of this kind out of ſight, except only thoſe which he hoped he could either
<pb facs="tcp:56355:187"/> blunder or pervert to ſome other Senſe.</p>
                  <p>Having given this ſhort, but juſt Character of his <hi>Book,</hi> I will ſay ſomething of my own; wherein I have taken Care, that this Ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dealing ſhould not tranſport me into any <hi>Perſonal reflexions,</hi> and am plainly content to ſhew my <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary</hi> is either ignorantly or wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully miſtaken, without giving the <hi>Epithets</hi> that properly belong to both kinds of Miſtakes. Nor will I make it my chief buſineſs to confute his <hi>Book;</hi> but to render my <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe</hi> more uſeful than it could poſſibly have been, if I had only followed him through his various Windings and Turnings: I have Collected in every <hi>Century</hi> as many <hi>Teſtimonies,</hi> concerning <hi>Liturgies,</hi> and their <hi>Antiquity, Original</hi> and <hi>Uſe,</hi> as my Time would permit, or
<pb facs="tcp:56355:187"/> the Argument needs, though not all which might have been found; and I have placed theſe in the exact Order of time, under the ſeveral Names of the Fathers; and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the ſcattered Pieces which he objects, under every one of theſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers as I go along, giving a diſtinct anſwer to them all that are materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; which I judge to be the faireſt way, to find out the true Senſe of Antiquity in this Queſtion. And by this diſtinct and regular proceeding, I hope, not only to diſcover the Weakneſs of my <hi>Adverſaries</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Evidence, but to give a clearer and fuller account, of the early beginning and general uſe of <hi>Liturgick Forms,</hi> than hath yet been done by any who have Writ upon this Subject. And the uſe hereof may be Firſt, to confirm the Devout Members of our own
<pb facs="tcp:56355:188"/> 
                     <hi>Church,</hi> who are the greateſt and moſt conſiderable part of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in their juſt Veneration for thoſe <hi>Holy Forms,</hi> by which they daily ſerve God, when they find them ſo very agreeable to pure and genuin Antiquity; which the Romaniſts have deſerted, by new Additions to their Forms, conſonant to their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious Innovations and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions; and ſo have our High-flown Separatiſts alſo, by new pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to a <hi>Gift</hi> of <hi>Prayer</hi> long ſince ceaſed, and by <hi>Praying Extempore</hi> upon ordinary occaſions in Public Aſſemblies; a Method unknown to the Ancients, ever ſince there was a ſetled <hi>Chriſtian Church.</hi> And Secondly, I will not deſpair, but thoſe moderate <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> who honeſtly deſire to ſerve God in the beſt manner, and have been abuſed by Falſe-Teachers into an ill Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb facs="tcp:56355:188"/> of <hi>Forms,</hi> may by peruſing theſe <hi>Papers,</hi> lay aſide their Ill-grounded prejudices againſt <hi>Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies;</hi> when they clearly diſcern, that the moſt Pious and Learned of the Primitive Martyrs and <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> in the beſt and pureſt Ages of the <hi>Church,</hi> did always approve of and uſe preſcribed <hi>Forms,</hi> in their public Worſhip. So that they cannot reject <hi>Liturgies,</hi> as a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, carnal, cold and formal way of Praying, without condemming the Devotions of the beſt and deareſt Servants of God in all Ages, both of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian Church;</hi> Which is a cenſure as void of Truth and Modeſty, as it is of Charity and Humility. It is certain, Millions of Holy and Admirable Men, have <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> thus with wondrous Fervency, and God hath heard ſuch Prayers; and if they be lawful in themſelves, acept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb facs="tcp:56355:189"/> to Heaven, and ſufficient to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure what we Pray for; there can be no reaſon, why this Church ſhould not enjoyn them now, as all other Modern regular Churches do, and the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church alſo did.

                     <p n="1">§. 1. THough LITURGIES have great reputation from their Ancient uſe in the Church, and the principal deſign of this Tract be to prove that; yet ſince a late
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56355:192"/> Author is ſo bold to ſay, <hi>They pretend not to Scripture</hi>
                        <note n="(a)" place="margin">Diſcourſe concerning <hi>Liturgy,</hi> p. 1.</note>, I ſhall introduce my Diſcourſe by ſhewing, That <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies</hi> have a great reputation alſo for the teſtimony which the Scripture bears to them, not only as the Phraſes and main parts of them are the words of Scripture; but becauſe the Holy Bible makes it appear, That the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God from the beginning did generally uſe Forms of Prayer and Praiſes in their public Worſhip. The Learned <hi>Fagius</hi> thinks they are as old as the time of <hi>Enoſh,</hi> when Men <hi>began publickly to call upon the Name of the Lord</hi>
                        <note n="(b)" place="margin">Gen. iv. 26.</note>; but it is certain that the firſt piece of ſolemn Worſhip among the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> recorded in Scripture, is a Form of Praiſe ſung in parts by the Men and Women, after their delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from the <hi>Egyptians</hi>
                        <note n="(c)" place="margin">Exod. xv. ver. 1. compar'd with ver. 21.</note>. Soon after, God himſelf preſcribed a Form of Words, by which the Prieſt was to bleſs the People<note n="(d)" place="margin">Num 6.23.</note>, and Forms of Prayer for thoſe who offered their Firſt-fruits and Tithes<note n="(e)" place="margin">Deut. xxvi. ver. 5, &amp; 13.</note>; yea, God preſcribes a Form of Prayer for the Penitent <hi>Jews,</hi> and charges them, to <hi>Take words</hi> with them, and turn to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56355:192"/> the Lord and ſay, <hi>Take away all Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, &amp;c.</hi> and upon their uſing this Form He promiſes to heal their <hi>backſlidings, &amp;c.</hi>

And I could bring innumerable Proofs both out of Jewiſh and Chriſtian Writers (if it were needful) to ſhew that the Jews did worſhip God by Set Forms, and had a fixed Liturgy<note n="(h)" place="margin">Joſephus, Philo, P.

                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now from this ſhort, but full Evidence, we thus argue: If the Jews, who were Gods only People, and the beſt among them, even ſuch as were inſpired, and in the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56355:193"/> pureſt times of that Church, did worſhip God acceptably by Set Forms of Prayer in their public Devotions, then a <hi>Liturgy</hi> is no argument of a corrupted Church, no hindrance to ſervency, no way diſpleaſing to God, nor unfit for public Aſſemblies, as our Adverſary pretends: But neither he nor his Friends are able to produce one inſtance where either God diſliked Forms, or good Men complained of them, under the legal Diſpenſation. Therefore I may conclude, That <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies</hi> are very agreeable to the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament, and may be juſtified from many places thereof.</p>
                     <p n="2">§. 2. To this it may be objected, That though this Method of Praying was agreeable to the old Law, it is not ſuitable to Goſpel-times. To which I reply: <hi>Firſt,</hi> That this yields the Cauſe as to the Jewiſh Church, and is a clear acknowledgment, that the Faithful did then Worſhip God by Forms. But, <hi>Secondly,</hi> Since the Duties of Prayer and Praiſe are grounded on the ſame Reaſon now
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56355:193"/> that they were then, and neither are, nor were intended to be abrogated; they who ſay this, muſt aſſign ſome ſatisfactory Reaſon, why theſe Duties may not be performed now in the ſame manner that they were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed then, otherwiſe it is not probable that a Form, as ſuch, is unſuitable to the Goſpel way of Worſhip, eſpecially ſince Chriſt and his Apoſtles, who duly frequented the Temple-Worſhip (where theſe Men grant Forms were uſed) did never ſhew any diſlike of that way of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiping, and though they taxed their other Corruptions very freely, they joyned in theſe Forms, and never reproved the <hi>Jews</hi> for uſing them. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This way of ſerving God having been ſo anciently and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally uſed, if Jeſus had deſigned to alter it and ſet up the new <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempore</hi> Way, there ought to have been an expreſs abrogation of the Old Way, and a poſitive inſtitution of the New one, left upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, either in the Goſpels or Epiſtles: But it is ſo far from that, that we can prove our Lord
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56355:194"/> and his Apoſtles, allowed, made and uſed Forms of Prayer; For according to the cuſtom of the great Rabbies of that Age Jeſus taught his Diſciples a divine Form of Prayer, to be added to their other Forms, as the peculiar mark of their being his Scholars<note n="(n)" place="margin">Dr <hi>Lightf.</hi> Vol. 2. p. 158.</note>. And it is obſerved by learned Men, that Chriſt took every ſentence of this Form out of the Jewiſh Prayers then in uſe<note n="(o)" place="margin">Idem Exp. in <hi>Math.</hi> vi. 9. &amp; <hi>Grotii</hi> Com. in locum.</note>. <hi>So far</hi> (ſaith <hi>Grotius) was the Lord of the Church from all affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of unneceſſary Innovation.</hi> And we may note, that when they deſired he would teach them to pray, that was a proper occaſion to have reformed the old method of praying by Forms, if Chriſt had intended ſuch a thing; but inſtead of any ſuch intimation, he gives them a new Form, and copies the ſeveral Petitions out of the Jewiſh Liturgy, ſhewing thereby his appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of praying to God in a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed Form.

Again, His Prayer in the Garden (which was offered up (as S. <hi>Paul</hi> notes<note n="(r)" place="margin">
                           <hi>Hebr.</hi> v. 7.</note>) with extraordinary Devotion) was a Form, becauſe he thrice repeated the very ſame Words<note n="(s)" place="margin">
                           <hi>Math.</hi> xxvi. 44.</note>; and by the way this ſhews the folly of thoſe who pretend None can pray devoutly, unleſs they vary the phraſe every time they pray. To proceed, It is very probable that our Saviour uſed a Form of Prayer on the Croſs, extracted out of the XXIIth Pſalm, which begins, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me</hi>

The Apoſtles obſerved the Jewiſh hours of Prayer, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiped God with them both in their Temple and their Synagogues, but there is no account that they ſet up a New way of Praying, or diſliked the old; and S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> affirms, that they uſed the <hi>Lords Prayer</hi> even after

                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> Our Adverſary brings many Quotations to prove, that the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents did not believe the Lords Prayer was intended for a Form, but for a direction what things they ſhould pray for<note n="(z)" place="margin">Diſcourſe of Lit. p. 3, &amp; 4.</note>: But all that heap of Authors which he cites, affirm no more than <hi>that it was not only to be a Form, but alſo a direction.</hi> Which we freely grant; for if it were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended at all to be uſed as a Form; then Forms are agreeable to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel way of Worſhip, and the uſing it as a Form, doth not hinder it from being a direction to draw up other Forms by; for all Authentic Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies (and ours eſpecially) are ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on and drawn up by the Lord's
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56355:196"/> Prayer; The Collects for Grace being grounded on the three firſt Petitions; The Prayers for all Earthly Bleſſings are grounded upon the Requeſt <hi>for our daily Bread;</hi> The Confeſſions and Litanies for pardon and deliverance from Sin, and all other kinds of evil, upon the three laſt Petitions; and, The Thankſgivings, Hymns and Praiſes upon the Doxology. So that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but wonder at this Authors impertinent filling a whole Page with Quotations, to prove it lawful to uſe other Words in Prayer, while he is diſputing againſt us who allow and uſe Liturgies which are other Words, but ſuch as are agreeable to it, both as to the Form and Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of them: His buſineſs was to prove the Lord's Prayer was never intended by Chriſt, nor uſed by the Church as a Form: But almoſt every one of his Authors grant it was a Form even in the places he produces.

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56355:197"/> now conclude, That Chriſt did intend this Prayer for a Form, and ſo it was uſed by the Church in all Ages.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> We are often told of a Gift of Prayer which was in the Apoſtolick Church, and this Gift enabling Perſons (as they ſuppoſe) to expreſs their wants in <hi>Extempore</hi> Phraſes, made Forms (in that Age, however) uſeleſs.

To which I Reply, That the abſurd conſequences of this Expoſition ought to make our Author aſhamed of it, ſince it would follow from hence, That no Man in their public Aſſemblies (except the Miniſter) did Pray in the Spirit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Miniſter alone conceives the Prayer; and though it be <hi>Extempore</hi> to him, yet it is a Form to the whole Congregation, who muſt pray in his Words, and not exerciſe their own

And thus, <hi>Praying in the Holy Ghoſt</hi> (Jude <hi>ver.</hi> 20.) implies, Praying with that devotion and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency which we are moved to by the Holy Spirit; but then this is no extraordinary Gift, this is no more than what both Then and Now every good Man, by the ordinary aſſiſtance of the Spirit, might and may do, even by a Form; for he that repeats that ſo as to attend the Senſe, and heartily deſires every Petition may be granted, he prays by the Spirit, or in the Spirit, as theſe Scriptures exhort; and thus the People as well as the Prieſt (in public or private)
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56355:199"/> may and ought to pray in the Spirit. Which ſhews that theſe places rightly expounded, are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all to our Diſſenters pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended gift of Inventing new Words every time they Pray. We will grant there was ſuch a Gift in the Apoſtles times; But we judge St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> knew much better than they, what it was, and he thinks it was as Miraculous as the gift of Tongues, with which St. <hi>Paul</hi> joyns it: He ſaith it was given only to one, and affirms it was ceaſed long before his time; and ſeems to imply that the Forms which were made in his Days, had their Original from the Prayers, which were made at firſt by theſe inſpired Men; Whoſe Prayers thus conceived were written down, and ſo preſerved and uſed when the Gift it ſelf failed. And when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the agreeableneſs of all Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Liturgies in the Method, and even in many of the Phraſes and Forms, and their neer Reſemblance to each other, we may Rationally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they were all derived at firſt, from that One Spirit, which direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56355:200"/> all Inſpired Men in their new planted Churches, to ask fit and proper things almoſt in the very ſame Words. And thus the Gift of Prayer was ſo far from mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Liturgies to be uſeleſs, that it really was the firſt ground and Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of them, being Forms firſt endited by the Spiritual and Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Men in the Apoſtolical Age, and Tranſmitted down to us by their Succeſſors; For which reaſon we ought to Reverence Ancient and Primitive Forms (many of which (as will be proved) are yet in our Liturgy) far before thoſe Extempore Prayers, made by a pretended Gift, which hath been ceaſed above 1300 years. And if we compare the proper Phraſes, acurate Method, and judicious well-weighed Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure of our Forms, with the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinence, Tautologies, Heſitation and Confuſion ſo viſible in their Extempore Prayers, we ſhall be convinced that the latter cannot proceed from the Spirit of God; nor ought to come in Competition, with our excellent Forms. And
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56355:200"/> this may ſuffice for the Scripture Period, which gives great Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Liturgies, and no Counten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to ſuch as now pretend to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempore Prayers.</p>

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56355:211"/> and therefore are ſaid to have as it were <hi>One common Voice:</hi> So that this paſſage is a Paraphraſe upon <hi>Ignatius</hi> his <hi>One Prayer</hi> and <hi>One Supplication,</hi> and upon <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi>'s <hi>Common Prayers;</hi> and it ſhews there were Forms mutually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated between Prieſt and People in <hi>Clemens Alex.</hi> his Time.

                        <note n="(a)" place="margin">Diſcourſe of Liturg. p. 136.</note>; but let it be noted, that <hi>Clemens</hi> is not ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Miniſter alone, but of him and the whole Congregation together; and if the Miniſter had ſaid all the Prayers, he muſt ſave ſaid plainly, <hi>They had one common Mouth, or Voice;</hi> but his Words are, <hi>Having as it were one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Voice;</hi> which notes, that they joyned Voices in reſponſory Forms, and ſo made many Voices like unto one Voice; and this uniting of the Miniſter and People in putting up their Common-Prayers, ſhewed alſo the union of their Minds and Affection. Moreover, we may the more reaſonably believe, that the Chriſtians had Forms in <hi>Clemens</hi> his Time, becauſe he ſaith, <hi>They allotted certain hours for Prayer, the Third, the Sixth

I reply, It proves no ſuch matter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe though the Prieſt did read his part out of a Book, the People might lift up their Hands and Eyes, ſo long as he prayed alone; and by frequent uſe of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56355:212"/> the common Forms, both they and he would be ſo ready at the accuſtomed Words, as to have liberty enough to look off from their Books and look up to Heaven, as we in this Church often do in the uſe of our Liturgy.</p>

He urges againſt this one paſſage of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> where deſcribing their Love-Feaſts he ſaith, <hi>After they have waſhed their hands and brought in Lights, they called for ſome to ſing either Pſalms, or ſomewhat of their own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing</hi>

But if we look on the place, we ſhall find this was after the public Worſhip was done, at their common Meal; and if this Hymn was taken out of the Pſalms, then it was a Form moſt certainly; or if it were of their own Compoſing, probably it was made at home; however, it will not follow, that now thoſe miraculous Gifts of Inſpiration are ceaſed, we may compoſe Extempore Hymns, becauſe they did it in an Age when many had thoſe Gifts.

But his main Objection out of <hi>Tertullian</hi> is that Phraſe of <hi>Sine monitore, quia de pectore, viz.</hi> That <hi>the Chriſtians prayed without a Monitor, becauſe they prayed out of their Breaſt,</hi> that is, as he expounds it, <hi>prayed Extempore</hi>

I confeſs Biſhop <hi>Bilſon</hi> modeſtly ſaith, <hi>This ſeemeth to be meant of the miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Gift of Prayer, which dured in the Church unto his time</hi>

                        <note n="(w)" place="margin">Id. ibid. pag. 437.</note>: So that if we allow this Biſhops Expoſition, none of our Adverſaries Conſequences will follow;
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:56355:215"/> for it doth no way prove, that Miniſters may now pray Extempore after the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Gift of Prayer is ceaſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe who had that Gift, prayed in that manner. Though I confeſs I ſee no need thus to expound the Phraſe; For allowing <hi>Rigaltius</hi> his ingenious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, that <hi>Tertullian</hi> here oppoſes the Chriſtians way of praying to the Pagans, who had a Monitor ſtanding by them when they recited their Solemn Forms, who prompted every Sentence to them that made the Prayer. But the difference lies in this, That the Chriſtians had their Prayers by heart, and could repeat them out of their Memory, and he who can remember a thing needs no Monitor<note n="(x)" place="margin">

Whereas it ſeems the Gentile Prieſts were not very perfect in their Prayers, and had not committed them to their Memory, becauſe they ſtood in need to have a Monitor for every Sentence. Now if this be the ſenſe, then it ſuppoſes the Chriſtians had Forms which they could ſay by heart, or repeat <hi>de pectore,</hi> and then it makes for us, and utterly diſcards Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempore Prayers.

Now theſe Prayers being not Vocal, there needed no Monitor for them, being only made (as S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> expreſſes it) <hi>ſilently and modeſtly within the ſecrets of their own Breaſts</hi>

But Thirdly, Upon a due ſurvey of the place it appears, <hi>Tertullian</hi> is here proving the Chriſtians ſincere Loyalty, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they exceeded the Heathens in this Vertue, and therefore made better Prayers for the Emperours, than their Pagan Subjects: For the Pagans had imbrued their hands in their Emperours

                     <p n="1">§. 1. THough we have more Writers, and conſequently more Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in this than in the former Age, concerning Common and preſcribed Forms, yet there are ſeveral Reaſons why the Fathers of this Century do not frequently mention the Words of thoſe Forms: Firſt, Becauſe their buſineſs was chiefly to convert Heathens and confute Hereticks, and moſt of their Writings being upon thoſe Subjects, they had little occaſion to Mention their Ways of Worſhip, which in thoſe days of Perſecution was performed generally in private. Secondly, They knew the Heathens derided their Worſhip, and would ridicule and blaſpheme it, if they had known it; and the Hereticks who diſowned the Churches Authority which compoſed theſe Offices, would not allow any Argument drawn from
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:56355:217"/> the public Service; ſo that it was not fit to quote their Liturgy when they writ either to the one or the other of theſe two ſorts of Adverſaries. Thirdly, They kept the Knowledge of theſe Forms from their very Catechu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens, till they were actually baptized, and kept them as a ſecret and ſacred Myſtery among the Faithful, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cautiouſly forbore the Mention of them in ſuch Writings as were to come into all hands. I know <hi>Daileé</hi> pretends this opinion and practice of keeping theſe Myſteries ſecret, did not obtain till after the end of theſe three Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries<note n="(a)" place="margin">

But he is groſly miſtaken, as I could prove by many paſſages; but I will only inſtance in two, <hi>viz. Tertullian</hi> in the laſt Age, and S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> in this: the former argues, that the Heathens could not know what the Chriſtian Worſhip was, becauſe the Faithful would not diſcover it, <hi>ſince it was cuſtomary to keep all Myſteries ſecret—eſpecially ſuch as were puniſhed, if they were diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. And Strangers</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>could have no knowledge of them, ſince even pious Initiations ever keep out the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane</hi>
                        <note n="(b)" place="margin">Ex formâ omnibus my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteriis ſilentii fides debeatur— <hi>&amp; pp.</hi>—unde extraneis noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae, cum etiam piae initiationes arceant profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos. <hi>Tert.

                        </note>; that is, not only the Heathens,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:56355:217"/> but the Chriſtians in their pious ways of Worſhip kept out all Strangers, and ſuch as were not fit to know them. Thus <hi>Tertullian</hi> and S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> tells an Heathen, who reviled Chriſtianity, he ought not to anſwer him; <hi>becauſe that which is holy is to be kept in our own Breaſt; for our Lord ſaith, we muſt not declare it to Swine, and expoſe it to Dogs</hi>

Wherefore ſince it is ſo clear even in theſe early Ages, that they were ſcrupulous of publiſhing their ways of Worſhip, we may conclude that no full and clear account of their Forms at large can be expected among theſe Writers: And it is ſufficient that they mention ſome, and darkly hint at others of thoſe Myſterious Forms ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and that they do plainly atteſt they had a preſcribed Liturgy, though they had but ſeldom an occaſion or an inclination to tell us what it was.</p>

Indeed our Adverſary uſes many Artiſices to wreſt this Teſtimony from us<note n="(i)" place="margin">Diſcourſe of Liturg p. 141.</note>, but all in vain: Firſt, he ſaith, Ruffinus <hi>made many additions to</hi> Origens <hi>Homilies, ſo that poſſibly this may be one of his Additions.</hi> I Anſwer, If he were ſure <hi>Ruffinus</hi> added this, yet ſince he lived in the next Century, that would ſerve to confute him, who maintains there were no preſcribed Forms till the Fifth or Sixth Age: But we can make it very probable <hi>Ruffinus</hi> did not add this paſſage; Firſt, becauſe there is nothing
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:56355:219"/> in it, but what agrees, well enough to <hi>Origen</hi>'s time, and to his Doctrin. Secondly, In <hi>Ruffinus</hi> his time they had made ſome ſteps towards <hi>Invocation of Saints,</hi> and therefore had it been a Prayer compoſed by him, there would have been ſome footſteps of that Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition; ſome Addreſs to, or expectation from the Apoſtles and Prophets; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as this Prayer only ſuppoſes them to be in Heaven, and deſires God to grant us a part with them. Again, Our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary ſaith, <hi>Theſe Words (if they be</hi> Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gens) <hi>will no more prove this was a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed Form, than S.</hi> Paul<hi>'s was,</hi> Epheſ. I. 16, 17. <hi>where he ſaith; He ceaſed not to make mention of the</hi> Epheſians <hi>in his Prayers, that the God of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt — might give them tht Spirit of Wiſdom, &amp;c.</hi> I Reply, His Parallel will by no means hold, ſince the Apoſtle only relates and reckons up the things he asked for them; and ſpeaking to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> gives them an account of the Subject of his Petitions for them. But <hi>Origen</hi> is repeating the Words of a Prayer, and ſpeaks directly to God, therefore this muſt be a Form of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon uſe, as the <hi>Magdeburg</hi> Divines
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:56355:220"/> believed it to be. Having thus detected his Sophiſtry and anſwered his Cavils, and ſo cleared this Evidence for a Set Form, we ſhall more eaſily underſtand that <hi>Origen</hi> refers to an uſual Liturgy in another place, where he ſaith, <hi>They who ſerve God, through Jeſus, in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian way, and live according to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, uſe frequently (as becomes them) night and day the enjoyned Prayers</hi>

                        <note n="(r)" place="margin">Diſc. of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turg. pag 140.</note>?

Note alſo, <hi>Origen</hi> doth not ſay, <hi>The Chriſtians made theſe enjoyned Prayers, but uſed, them;</hi> which ſuppoſes they were made, into a preſcribed Form before. Thirdly, He enquires, <hi>If there be no Commands for Praying frequently, but Human Preſcriptions?</hi> and I muſt ask, what is this to the purpoſe? <hi>Origen</hi> is not ſpeaking of Commanding Men to pray, nor declaring whether the Duty of Prayer be preſcribed by God or the Church: He is ſpeaking of the Prayers themſelves, and gives them this Character that they were <hi>Ordered</hi> or <hi>Preſcribed:</hi> ſo that he is very imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to tell us of Divine Commands to pray frequently, ſince <hi>Origen</hi>'s Words are not about <hi>Obeying a Precept to Pray;</hi> but uſing ordered, enjoyned or preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed Prayers, which all ingenuous Men muſt own to be in Forms, and that proves a <hi>Liturgy,</hi> becauſe it is <hi>[Prayers]</hi> in the plural Number.

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:56355:226"/> of the things deſired, when the ſpeech is directed to a Man. Now theſe Words are no Prayer, nor addreſſed to God; S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> is only telling Pope <hi>Lucius,</hi> what things in general they ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for him.

To his ſecond inference, <hi>viz.</hi> that ſuppoſing this were the <hi>common Form, he need not have told</hi> Lucius <hi>of it:</hi> I reply, if this were then the <hi>African</hi> Form to ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate for Confeſſors, yet <hi>Cyprian</hi> might rationally give <hi>Lucius</hi> an account of it; Firſt, becauſe it is not certain that they at <hi>Rome</hi> knew the Form of Praying for a Confeſſor at <hi>Carthage;</hi> or if they did, <hi>Lucius</hi> could not know, till he was thus informed, that it was uſed for him: So that whether it was the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Form or no, it will not ſerve out Adverſaries purpoſe; for let it be noted,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:56355:226"/> if S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> had Prayed to God for <hi>Lucius</hi> every day Extempore in various and other Words, he had told him a manifeſt Untruth, when he ſaid he Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for him in theſe words, <hi>That he who is perfect, &amp;c.</hi> So that if theſe had been the words which S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> uſed for <hi>Lucius,</hi> (as he ſuppoſes,) they muſt have been a Form, and were preſcribed for that occaſion by S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> to his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Clergy. His ſecond allegation out of S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> for ſuch occaſional Prayers, is <hi>that there are alſo mention of ſuch occaſional Prayers, in the Epiſtle to</hi> Moſes <hi>and</hi> Maximus<note n="(q)" place="margin">Diſc. of Liturg. p. 68.</note>; but he durſt not cite the place at large, which on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeaks of private Prayers made by theſe Confeſſors in Priſon, in which S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> deſires to be remembred, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving God would grant them whatever they prayed for: But there are no pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions mentioned, nor any account whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they prayed with or without a Form; ſo that this Quotation is as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent, as his third inſtance is frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulent; For he cites S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> to prove that the Form of Words uſed in Baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was varied by ſome; but he leaves out thoſe Words, which utterly ſpoil his

And though I am not bound to anſwer all his random Queſtions and ſuppoſitions, grounded upon this Negative, that <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius</hi> doth not ſay, He did alter the Liturgy: Yet I ſhall Reply, That <hi>Hymns</hi> are more proper than <hi>Prayers</hi> are, to ſet out and magnifie our Saviour's Divinity, and ſo were much more offenſive to this Heretick, than the Prayers, which were only addreſſed to the Father in the Name of Chriſt, as our Mediator, which the <hi>Arians</hi> allowed him to be: And therefore <hi>Paulus</hi> began to reject the <hi>Hymns;</hi> but probably he might have

                     <p n="1">§. 1. THat the Uſe of Forms and ſtated Liturgies did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, in the end of the Fifth, nor in the entrance of the Sixth Century, is very plain from the preceding Teſtimonies, which ſufficiently confute our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries Aſſertion. Yet if we had no Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of ſetled Forms of Prayer before this Age, it had been enough to juſtifie our uſe of them, becauſe this is the firſt Century wherein the miraculous Gifts were ceaſed, and the Church was ſetled under Chriſtian Magiſtrates. Wherefore ſince we plead for the uſe of a preſcribed Liturgy in an eſtabliſhed Church, it is as much Antiquity as our Cauſe needs, to ſhew we have Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents for it from this Age; that is, as ſoon as the Primitive Churches Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and ours did agree. Now the Centuriators tell us, that upon the Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:56355:230"/> of the Church, <hi>The Biſhops ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Prayers for all things neceſſary, for the happy ſtate of the Empire, for the Emperours, for the ſafety of the Church, for public Peace, and for the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nconverted</hi>

                        </note>. Now if the Biſhops appointed ſuch Prayers, doubtleſs the Inferiour Clergy did uſe them, and that ſhews there was a preſcribed Liturgy: Yet our Adverſary ſtrives by all kinds of Artifice to hide this plain Truth, and the firſt Authors he produces in this Century are <hi>Arnobius</hi> and <hi>Lactantius,</hi> to prove the Chriſtians looked up to Heaven when they prayed<note n="(b)" place="margin">Diſcourſe of Liturg. pag. 9.</note>. Which we freely grant; but reject his conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of their having no Written Forms, ſince Experience ſhews, that both Prieſt and People, by frequent uſe of our Common Prayer, may and do often look up to Heaven, when they pray by this Form. And as for one of theſe very Fathers,<note place="margin">

                        </note>, yet there are ſome Intimations in him of the uſe of Forms: <hi>We adore</hi> (ſaith he)

To venerate this ſupreme King is the end and deſign of theſe</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Offices—: <hi>To him, according to cuſtom, we all proſtrate our ſelves, adoring him with our joynt Prayers, and requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him things, juſt, honeſt and fit for his holy Ears</hi>

Secondly, That it was reckoned a pious thing to compoſe and learn a Form of Prayer; which <hi>Euſebius</hi> would not have commended, if Forms had not been eſteemed lawful, and commonly uſed in public; And, Thirdly, That thoſe who uſe Forms of Prayer, either by committing them to memory, or by frequent uſe, might often lift up their Eyes to Heaven in the repeating of them. So that we may grant his Inſtance of <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s Effigies <hi>on his Coin, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented as in a praying poſture, with Hands and Eyes lifted up to Heaven</hi>

For ſince we are ſure he uſed Forms, this only ſhews the folly of his arguing from that poſture, that ſuch as did uſe it could not pray by a Form. I ſhall therefore conclude this Evidence with this further Obſervation, That we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not doubt that Chriſtians had accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed themſelves to pray by Forms in Public before the time of this Religious
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:56355:232"/> Prince, who was guided by thoſe Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops who had been Confeſſors for the Faith, and yet compoſed and uſed Forms of Prayer, and was highly commended for it; nor did any of that Age object this, as any Innovation in the Chriſtian Worſhip; but <hi>Euſebius</hi> particularly rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kons it as an Inſtance of his Piety, that <hi>He ordered all his Army at a certain Signal given by one Man, to ſend up one and the ſame premeditated Prayer to God</hi>

So that to go about to prove, That S. <hi>James</hi> did not compoſe that whole Office which is now extant under

Now that the main of this Office was uſed long before at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> I think is very clear from the harmony and agreement which we find between

That there was anciently ſuch a Form of Prayers uſed in the Church of</hi> Jeruſalem: But our Adverſary objects<note n="(t)" place="margin">Diſc. of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turg. pag. 149. &amp;c. ad p. 154.</note>. Firſt, That this Liturgy is not mentioned by any Fathers or Councils: I reply, The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of it, and the very Words are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by many Fathers, and the very name and Title, (as we have ſhewed) are found in <hi>Proclus,</hi> and in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Trullo.</hi> Secondly, If S. <hi>James</hi> made it (he ſaith,) it ought to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Apoſtolical, and ought never to be added to, diminiſhed or altered.
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:56355:241"/> Anſwer, If S. <hi>James</hi> had made it for his Church of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> other Apoſtles might make other Forms for other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical Churches; ſo that S. <hi>James</hi> his Liturgy would not have ben neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for all places. But he knows, we hold that S. <hi>James,</hi> and the other Apoſtles Celebrated the Sacrament at firſt, by very ſhort Forms, probably uſing <hi>only the Lords Prayer, the Words of Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, and an Hymn of praiſe: and while there were inſpired Biſhops, they added divers Collects, Reſponſes and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faces, which being writ down and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, brought forth the Primitive Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies in the next Age, after thoſe Miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Gifts of Prayer ceaſed.</hi> Now ſince all Liturgies retain thoſe things which are eſſential and were certainly Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical, in other parts of the Office, every Church may vary as they find expedient. Thirdly, He objects that there are many Corruptions and groſs Superſtitions in this Liturgy. Anſwer, We freely confeſs it, and as freely own, that none of theſe are either Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, or ſo much as Ancient; But let it be noted theſe Corruptions crept in by the itch of altering, which hath infected
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:56355:241"/> every Age, and all Churches; and by this means brought in all the Corrupt Opinions of every Age, into the ſervice of God; thus the names of Saints and <hi>Ora pro nobis</hi> got into the <hi>Roman</hi> Lita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, about the ninth Age, or ſomwhat la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but he would be an odd <hi>Logician,</hi> who ſhould argue that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church had no Litany before the ninth Age, becauſe the invocation of Saints, came in about that time; Since in their Litany, there are other Petitions very Pious and agreeable to the Doctrin of the pure and Primitive Church; yea, the very Phraſes are found in the moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and Orthodox Fathers; and there are yet extant ſome Manuſcript Lita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, without any names of Saints. So as to this Liturgy, there are many Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions in it, which are modern Additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but there are alſo many Pious and excellent Prayers, agreeable to Scripture, and to the beſt Antiquity; yea, the very Words of which are found in the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox and elect Fathers. Fourthly, Therefore whereas he objects, <hi>that we had better wholly reject this Liturgy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we know not how to ſeparate the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions from what is pure and Orthodox.</hi>
                        <pb n="102" facs="tcp:56355:242"/> I reply, We can eaſily diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them; for we deſire to juſtify no more of this Liturgy, than what is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Scriptures, and to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin and Practice of the firſt four Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies. And there is enow of thoſe Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive paſſages in this Liturgy, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince any reaſonable Man, that there was a Form of public Prayers and Praiſes preſcribed and uſed in the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> long before S. <hi>Cyrils</hi> time; and therefore I place this Liturgy here, as being an Authentic Evidence, there were Forms of Prayer allowed in this Age, which is all that I am concerned to prove.

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:56355:245"/> and agreeable to the Opinion and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of theſe Ages, being free from thoſe groſſer Corruptions of the later Times, ſuch as Invocation of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> the Saints and Angels; Adoration of Images, Croſſes and Relicks; the Sacrifice Propitiatory of the Maſs; the Popes Infallibility and Supremacy, with ſuch like: Yea, this Liturgy being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to have been uſed in this Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, and not mentioning any of theſe things, is a good proof, That they are all notorious Corruptions and Innovations; there is nothing but ſome Charitable Prayers for the Dead, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to Purgatory, which can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted againſt in theſe Offices; becauſe we ſee in <hi>Arnobius</hi> and others, that this Uſage was crept into the Chriſtian Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, at leaſt as early as the beginning of this Century. Wherefore we conclude, that theſe Conſtitutions, and the Forms contained therein are a clear and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing Evidence, that a preſcribed Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy was uſed in this Age.</p>
                     <p>But, Secondly, our Adverſary goes on to raiſe other Scruples; For he tells us out of this Author, that they were ſo ſtrict in concealing their Myſteries, that
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:56355:246"/> if a Catechumen by chance had been preſent, they immediately Baptized him<note n="(p)" place="margin">Diſcourſe of Liturg. pag. 43. Marg.</note>. I Anſwer, It is very pleaſant for him to cite a Book wherein all theſe Myſteries are written down at large, to prove there were no Myſteries written down in that Age; and it is very weak, or ſomething worſe, to ſay they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed them from the Faithful, becauſe they kept them ſecret from the Catechu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens: He knew very well that in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>is Age they did write down their Offices, but charged the Prieſts and Faithful, to keep theſe Words and Writings from the Unbaptized. Another Objection is, That <hi>the Creed ſet down in the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, is not the ſame with the Apoſtles Creed, therefore there was no certain Form of Creed</hi>
                        <note n="(w)" place="margin">Diſcourſe of Liturg. p. 103.</note>. I Reply, The Creed here ſet down was the Form then uſed in that Church, of which this Author was a Member (probably of <hi>Antioch</hi>)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And as new Hereſies aroſe, it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for all Churches to make larger Paraphraſes upon ſome Articles of the old Creed, to ſecure all that were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the Church againſt thoſe Hereſies: But ſtill this Creed thus Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſed, was a Form preſcribed to all
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:56355:246"/> that were Baptized in that Dioceſs, and that is enough to prove there were Forms uſed in every Church; nor do I ſee any thing that he can infer from hence, but that ſince the Apoſtles made that Creed which goes by their Name, and yet this Creed differs from it; therefore the Apoſtles did not make theſe Conſtitutions themſelves, which we freely confeſs. Like this, is his Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection about the Form of renouncing the Devil in Baptiſm, which is not ſet down in the ſame Words in theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, as it is in other Fathers<note n="(x)" place="margin">Diſcourſe of Liturg. p. 106.</note>. I Reply, This was the Form at <hi>Antioch,</hi> that in S. <hi>Cyril</hi> was the Form at <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> that in S. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> the Form at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and the difference between them is ſo very ſmall, that it ſhews they all were taken from one Original; and all Churches had Forms of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation; yet in ſeveral Dioceſſes they had ſome diverſity in expreſſing it; but this doth not prove either that they had no Forms, nor that any Inferiour Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter was left at liberty to expreſs it as he pleaſed, theſe being obliged to keep to the Form preſcribed in their own Church. I ſhall only deſire the Reader
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:56355:247"/> to obſerve, that in that large Margin, where he hath heaped up variety of Forms of Renouncing the Devil, one half of them are not the Words of any Churches Form, but only ſhort and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſional deſcriptions of it in lax Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, and ſo are not to be urged as various Forms. Laſtly, He picks up ſeveral Phraſes diſperſed up and down the Conſtitutions, pretending that the Prieſt was at liberty to ſay thoſe or ſuch like Prayers and Praiſes<note n="(y)" place="margin">Diſcourſe of Liturg. p. 110, 111.</note>. But firſt, He falſly expounds moſt of theſe Phraſes; for when that Author ſaith, <hi>The Prieſt muſt pray, or ſay thus;</hi> or, <hi>muſt ſay theſe Words, or thoſe which follow</hi>

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:56355:247"/> Rubric before it ſaith, <hi>The Prieſt ſhall abſolve him after this ſort</hi>

                        </note>. Wherefore the Author never meant by theſe Phraſes, to leave the Prieſt to ſay what Prayers he pleaſed in an Extempore way; and indeed when he hath ſet down a Form, a Prayer made Extempore is not <hi>ſuch a like Prayer,</hi> nor <hi>a Prayer after that ſort.</hi> But ſuppoſe we ſhould grant (which I do not think we need yield,) that theſe Phraſes do ſignifie their making any other Form like this, ſtill this obliges them to Forms; and being theſe Phraſes are but four times in all that large Book of Offices, it was no great matter to leave the Biſhop (eſpecially) at liberty, to change the Form three or four times in ſo great variety of <hi>Prayers, Praiſes,</hi> and <hi>Benedictions.</hi> And if all the reſt were fixed and ſtated Forms, from which none might vary, that is enough to prove my Poſition; and this Objection can no more weaken it, than a Mans alledging, <hi>that Canon of Praying before Sermon in this Form, or to this effect</hi>

                     <p>To this my Adverſary Objects, That if the Canon be ſo expounded, then it decrees that one and the ſame Form ſhall be uſed at ſeveral Hours. I Reply, The Prayers at Three (which is the beginning of the Evening, when the Sun declines apace) were then, as they are now, <hi>Prayers proper for the Evening,</hi> and ſo might well enough be uſed when the Evening Hymns were ſung, eſpecially by ſuch as by neceſſary buſineſs were not at the Church at Three in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon. And it is plain, that though there were Forms of Hymns at Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting (as my Adverſary takes pains to prove); yet there ſeems to have been no diſtinct Form of Prayer for this Seaſon; under which pretence ſome bold
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:56355:255"/> and zealous Men (like our Diſſenters) would have brought in their own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſures, which the Church here forbids, and ties them up to the ſame Forms which were uſed at Three in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon. We conclude therefore, That this Council liked not Extempore Prayers, nor Forms made by private Perſons, Laity or Clergy, but obliged all to the ſame Liturgy, when it was proper for the ſeveral Seaſons. I need not anſwer his Inſtances about the ſeveral ſtated Forms of Hymns and Prayers for the ſeveral Hours of Prayer, ſince if this were in the Time of the <hi>Laodicean</hi> Council or before, it makes againſt him, and proves preſcribed Forms were much Ancienter than he is willing to grant; and yet theſe mentioned in the Canon being Evening Prayers, might properly be ſaid either in the beginning or the cloſe of the Evening: But if his Inſtances of ſuch Forms be later than this Council, they are impertinent; ſince the following Ages made more Hours of Prayer, and more proper Forms to them than were known in the Time of the Council of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> which rather than it would endure ſuch Prayers as our Adverſary
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:56355:255"/> contends for, made them ſay the ſame Office over again at Candle-lighting, which ſome of them had repeated before at Three in the Afternoon. And thus we ſee theſe Evening Prayers were Forms.</p>
                     <p>There is another Canon in this ſame Council,<note place="margin">Can. XIX. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. <hi>Laodicen.</hi>
                        </note> which is a clear proof that the Morning Prayers, when the Euchariſt was adminiſtred, were Forms alſo: For the XIXth Canon exactly deſcribes the Order of this Service, as <hi>S.

But if we grant this, it will be no advantage to him, becauſe Forms of Prayer are more capable of being kept to one certain Order, than Extempore Prayers can be: And there is one thing in this Canon which makes it more than probable, that the Prayers for the Faithful were Forms; and that is the Reaſon why (as this Canon ſpeaks) <hi>they diſmiſſed the Catechumens;</hi> which ſeems to be for fear by daily hearing theſe Forms, they ſhould remember the Phraſes of theſe Myſteries, and diſcover them to profane and common Ears: For if theſe Prayers had been Extempore, and the Phraſes varied every day (as my Adverſary pretends) the Catechumens might ſafely have ſtayed there, it being impoſſible they ſhould ſo learn or remember thoſe
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:56355:257"/> various Expreſſions, as to relate them to any body after they were gone home. Finally, Why ſhould we not believe this Order, was the Method of the public Forms of Prayer; there being the ſame Order exactly obſerved in all thoſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Forms which are extant at this day; and not one word that intimates any ſuch thing as an Extempore Prayer, or frequent variation of the Forms either in this Council, or in any Father or Council about this time? And this may ſuffice for theſe Canons which after all his ſhuffling Objections are good Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for a ſtated Liturgy in this Age.</p>

                        </note>. So that the very order of repeating the Lord's Prayer at the Altar, in the beginning of the Prayers for the Faithful (which was but of Eccleſiaſtical Inſtitution) could not be changed. Moreover we find in <hi>Optatus, That there was a Rumor ſpread upon the coming of ſome from the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, that Alterations would be made in the Communion Service, which ſtartled the People; but they were quieted again when they ſaw The Solemn Cuſtom and wonted Rite obſerved, and diſcerned, that nothing was changed, added or diminiſhed in the Divine Sacrifice</hi>

                        </note>. From whence it appears there was a known Form for the Communion, an Office ſo well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by the People, that they could perceive when it was altered in any particular: So that doubtleſs thoſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians were not uſed to variety of Phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, nor accuſtomed to the Extempore Man's Fancy, to celebrate in a longer or ſhorter Form, as he pleaſed.

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:56355:260"/> yet that is the liberty this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor pleads for.

And Secondly, He doth appeal to the public Forms, and ſo tells him what Words he did uſe; for he ſaith <hi>when we make that Prayer, according to the Communion Office, we ſay, for all Biſhops, and for you alſo: Keep him who Preacheth the Truth;</hi> Or certainly thus, <hi>Hear us Lord, and keep him that he may Preach the Word of Truth, as the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion required, and as the Office for Prayer directed</hi>

But Secondly, I will take no advantage from
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:56355:269"/> hence; for (after all) I ſee no Reaſon to deny the piece to be Genuin; but let it be as he pleaſes, it maks nothing for his purpoſe; For S. <hi>Baſil</hi> doth not affirm, that theſe Euchariſtical Prayers were not written in his time, but that they were derived from an unwritten Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Now this ſufficiently proves, that anciently they were Forms, becauſe it is impoſſible for an Extempore Prayer, that is to be daily or often varied, to be conveied down from our Fore-Fathers by Tradition; whatever is ſo delivered muſt be a Form of words, either writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten or learned by heart, and ſo taught by the Elder to the younger Prieſts; Wherefore even in this Senſe, theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional Prayers in the Sacramental Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations, were Forms made by the moſt Primitive Fathers, and taught to their Succeſſors, and ſo conveyed down by oral Tradition. But Thirdly, this is his Fallacious perverting of S. <hi>Baſils</hi> Words, and not the true Senſe of them, For the (<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>) <hi>unwritten Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions here ſpoken of by S.</hi> Baſil, are not things which never were written down by the Fathers (as he falſly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends): Becauſe both he and divers
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:56355:270"/> of the Ancients had written about many of the Rites and Uſages, which he there calls (<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>) unwrirten Traditions, an Hundred times. As for inſtance, about the hours of Prayer, turning to the Eaſt, when they prayed, and about the Prefaces before the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, &amp;c. But S. <hi>Baſil</hi> only ſaith, <hi>theſe things were not written in Scripture,</hi> they were not enjoyned there, thoſe Saints or holy Men, <hi>viz.</hi> the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts, had not left Orders in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for theſe Rites and Forms; which muſt be his meaning, becauſe he goes on and ſaith, <hi>We are not content with that which is Recorded in the Apoſtles and the Goſpels:</hi> That is, beſides the words of inſtitution, there were Forms of Prayer and Praiſe before and after, in the Sacraments, delivered down from the Primitive Fathers, which he doth not ſay were never writ down by them, but were not writ in Scripture. For S. <hi>Baſil</hi> calls the Scripture by way of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>) not written things;
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:56355:270"/> which is further clear by the occaſion of this whole Chapter, wherein S. <hi>Baſil</hi> is vindicating himſelf, for uſing a Phraſe and Form of Doxology which was not written in Scripture; and his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is, That the Church uſed many Rites and Forms, which were not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Bible; ſuch as renouncing the Devil, and Praying toward the Eaſt, and the Forms uſed in Sacramental Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations: Now <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus, Tertullian, Cyprian</hi> and many others (as we have ſhewed,) had written concerning every one of theſe things; but ſtill they were (<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>) not written in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but derived from Tradition; and therefore they ought not (ſaith S. <hi>Baſil</hi>) to blame me, if I uſed a Form of Doxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy not written in Scripture. Now this clear expoſition of the place alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhews our Authors baſe diſingenuity, who to ſerve a turn, and patch up an Argument againſt Liturgies, wilfully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts S. <hi>Baſil</hi>'s words; which being right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtood, are ſo far from condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Forms, or proving they were not written, that they prove they were compoſed long before S <hi>Baſil's</hi> time and then owned for Catholic Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:56355:271"/> Finally whereas he inſinuates, that S. <hi>Boſil</hi> counts theſe Forms to be Myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries not to be publiſhed, and thence infers that to write them down, was to publiſh them, and therefore doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they were not written down. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, That theſe Forms were daily uſed among the Faithful, and they were not nice to publiſh them to theſe; it was only the Catechumens and Infidels from whom they kept theſe Myſteries; and conſidering the charge they laid upon the Faithful and the Prieſts not to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulge them to thoſe who were without the Church; there was no need to be afraid to write them down, ſince the Books were only in their cuſtody, who then believed it was a damnable Sin, to let the Unbaptized ſee theſe Books, or hear the words of them. And he hath anſwered this Argument himſelf, by ſhewing us, that the Heathens (who alſo counted their Forms of worſhip to be Myſteries, not to be divulged to the uninitiated) did write theſe Forms in Books, which were kept by their Prieſts<note n="(n)" place="margin">Compare Diſc. of Liturg. pag. 28 with 122. &amp; 123.</note>; Therefore writing is very conſiſtent, with concealing Myſteries from Strangers. And there is nothing
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:56355:271"/> in this place of S. <hi>Baſil,</hi> which proves there were no written Prayers in his time.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He alledges that S. <hi>Baſil</hi> in Prayer with the People, uſed the Doxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy two ways, both <hi>Glory be to God and the Father, with the Son and with the holy Ghoſt</hi>—, and —, <hi>by the Son in the holy Ghoſt</hi>

<pb n="162" facs="tcp:56355:272"/> the Prayers with the People.</hi> Now theſe Homilies or Sermons being S. <hi>Baſil</hi>'s own compoſures, he thought he might vary the Doxology there, as he uſed to do at other times, but fortuning to uſe an expreſſion that ſavoured of the <hi>Arian</hi> Hereſy, The Orthodox People, who had been uſed to a right Form of Doxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy in their Liturgy, ever ſince the days of <hi>Gregory Thaumaturgus,</hi> (as was ſhewed before) were able by that, to cenſure <hi>theſe new and ſtrange ways of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing himſelf</hi>

Wherefore this variety of Doxology, being not uſed in the Liturgy, but the Sermons or Homilies, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to his purpoſe; nor will it prove that S. <hi>Baſil</hi> varied from the preſcribed Forms, much leſs will it make out, there were no preſcribed Forms, ſince our Clergy uſe variety of Doxologies at the end of their Sermons; but it would be Ridiculous to Argue from thence, that they will not be bound to ſay the <hi>Gloria Patri,</hi> in that Form wherein it is ſet down in the Liturgy. If it be again objected, that S. <hi>Baſil</hi> hath great variety

But if my Adverſaries will not allow this variation to have been any where but in the Prayers, though there is no Reaſon to allow that, yet ſuppoſing it were ſo, Then this was an Action of S. <hi>Baſil,</hi> which is not to be imitated; and ſince he had like to have run into Hereſy, by taking this undue
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:56355:273"/> liberty, it will make nothing for the Credit of Extempore Prayers, that they expoſe ſuch as uſe them to the danger at leaſt, of venting Heretical expreſſions involuntarily. And S. <hi>Baſils</hi> being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to beg Pardon for it, ſhews it ought not to be quoted for a Precedent; yet after all, it this variation were in the Prayers, it ſhews there were then Forms well known to the People, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms us, in the neceſſity of preſcribing and impoſing ſuch Forms, to prevent Hereſy from creeping into the Church; which otherwiſe may get ground even, by the well meant expreſſions of ſome Eminent Extempore Man.</p>

                     <p>Let us now examine what our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary hath gathered out of S. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> to oppoſe this plain Proof: Firſt, He is one of thoſe Authors, who calls the Prayer of Conſecration, <hi>A Myſtery;</hi> and this he tells us twice over<note n="(a)" place="margin">Diſcourſe of Liturgy p. 28, &amp; 29.</note>. But yet we have ſhewed, that he hath actually writ it down; ſo that it could not be his meaning, That it was ſuch a Myſtery as might not be committed to Writing; and that ſhews, that our Author gets no advantage to his Cauſe by citing this
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:56355:283"/> place<note n="(b)" place="margin">
                           <hi>Ambroſ.</hi> de Fide ad <hi>Grat.</hi> lib. 4. cap. 5.</note>. Secondly, He would prove that S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> counted Praying <hi>Extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porè,</hi> to be praying by the Spirit, and for this he quotes his Epiſtle to <hi>Horon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianus</hi>
                        <note n="(c)" place="margin">Diſcourſe of Liturg. pag. 60.</note>. I Anſwer, S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> is not ſpeaking of the Public Service, but of private Prayer in that place, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Allegation is impertinent: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, He doth not ſay, the Spirit fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes us with Words and Phraſes; but helps us to apply our Minds to pray, and keeps out Carnal thoughts, making us content with ſuch things, as we na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally wiſh to be quit of, becauſe they are for our good: And both here and elſewhere he explains that Phraſe of <hi>the Spirits helping our infirmities,</hi> Rom. viii 26. to be meant of the Spirits gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving us ſuch patience, that we ſhall not deſire to be preſently freed from our Afflictions<note n="(d)" place="margin">

In another place He expounds thoſe Words, <hi>Praying always in the Spirit,</hi> to ſignifie, <hi>Praying with a pure Conſcience, and a ſincere Faith, which he who prays by a Form may do</hi>
                        <note n="(e)" place="margin">Com. in Epheſ. vi. p. 516.</note>. And certainly, he who knew it was always his Duty, to pray by or with the Spirit, and yet
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:56355:284"/> uſed and approved a Form; muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it poſſible to pray in or by a Form, and yet to pray by or with the Spirit. Thirdly, My Adverſary objects a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage out of S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> his Epiſtle to his Siſter <hi>Marcellina,</hi> viz. <hi>That while he was Celebrating, he heard that the</hi> Arians <hi>had ſeized upon one</hi> Caſtulus, <hi>juſt as he was performing the general Collect; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he ordered the Prayer ſuitable to that Occaſion, which one that had been Fettered with preſcribed Forms could not have liberty to do</hi>
                        <note n="(f)" place="margin">Diſcourſe of Liturg pag. 67, &amp; 68.</note>. And here, firſt, I ſhall obſerve, He is to prove that the Inferiour Miniſters ought to be at liberty, to order all the Prayers, as they pleaſe, in the ordinary Service of God: But his uſage is to inſtance in ſome irregular Fact, upon ſome ſingle extraordinary occaſion, done by ſome great and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Biſhop; which, if his Inſtances prove true, will never juſtifie his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: And truly, this was an Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Biſhop, who was fit to make a Liturgy, and a very extraordinary Caſe, The City being all in an Uproar, and S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> was told in the middle of his Office, That his Friend <hi>Caſtulus</hi> was like to be murthered by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged

Here therefore we have a large Form in Words preſcribed and enjoyned by the Church, upon every Period of which this Holy Father makes a Comment; which he could not have done had it been uſually varied, or had it been an Extempore Prayer: The Form alſo is the manner of Litany, room being left for the People to ſay, <hi>Lord have mercy,</hi> after every Petition. And I muſt obſerve further, that this very Litany is very ſhort expreſſed in the Liturgies of S. <hi>Baſil</hi> and S. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> there being (in the former eſpecially) no more but the beginning of the Sentences; Thus, <hi>Ye Faithful for — That he would inſtruct — That he would reveal, &amp;c.</hi> which are the initial Words of the main
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:56355:292"/> Periods of this very Form which S. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom</hi> expounds, and it ſeems were ſo well known to the Deacons then, that it was enough to ſet down the initial Words of ſome Sentences, which proves it was conſtantly uſed and become familiar<note n="(z)" place="margin">Vid.

And it is much for the Credit of thoſe Liturgies, that S. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom</hi> in his genuine Works expounds a Form ſo very like thoſe in the Liturgies, that any Man may diſcern thoſe are the Epitome of this Larger Form. To this I muſt add, That the Author of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical Conſtitutions hath ſet down this Litany at large, many Petitions of it being the very ſame Words, <hi>viz. To hear their Prayers—To open the Ears of their Hearts— To bleſs their going out and coming in, &amp;c.</hi> And other Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are the very ſame things with very little alteration of the Phraſe—<hi>viz. To reveal to them the Goſpel of his Chriſt— To plant his holy and ſaving Fear in them — To make them medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate in his Law day and night— To grant them the Laver of Regeneration, and the Garment of Immortality, &amp;c.</hi>

<pb n="204" facs="tcp:56355:293"/> Phraſes, there is an exact harmony be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween this Litany in the Conſtitutions, and that in S. <hi>Chryſoſtom;</hi> the Variations being no more than may be expected from variety of Copies tranſcribed for the uſe of two ſeveral Dioceſſes, and corrected by two ſeveral Biſhops for their own Clergy: This is certain, That there was far more difference between the Miſſals of <hi>Salisbury</hi> and <hi>York,</hi> than are in theſe two Forms; yet both were uſed in one Kingdom, by thoſe who were Members of the ſame National Church. Nor can we wonder at theſe little differences in the ancient Litanies, conſidering the aptneſs of every Eminent Biſhop, to order ſomething in the public Service; it ſuffices to make my Poſition good, that they were Forms preſcribed, that probably had all ſprung from one Original; (For all theſe Old Eaſtern Litanies agree in the main) but ſome Phraſes, and ſomething of the order of the Petitions were varied in the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts for divers Provinces: And ſince this ſmall Variety was in S. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>'s Time, we may conclude, The Primitive Form from whence they were all derived muſt be much Elder.</p>

                           <hi>Proclus</hi> de traditione di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinae Miſſae.</note>. And the Greek Church hath ever ſince uſed this Liturgy, as the genuin compoſure of <hi>S. Chryſoſtom.</hi> Secondly, The main part of this Liturgy, is found either explicitly, or by plain intimations, in the genuin Works of <hi>S. Chryſoſtom,</hi> who reckons up the ſame Ceremonies, Hymns and Prayers, and generally in the ſame order. And alſo upon occaſion com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon, and explains both the Rites and ancient Forms; and covertly refers to many more paſſages in this Liturgy; only he would not ſpeak out,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:56355:296"/> becauſe his Homilies were Preached to a promiſcuous Auditory. Thirdly, There is a great part of this Liturgy, very pure, Primitive and worthy of this great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor; even ſo much of it as is Recorded in his own Writings, and in the Works of <hi>S. Cyprian, S. Cyril. S. Baſil. S. Auguſtin</hi> and others, or ſo much of it as is taken out of Holy Scripture. And in all this, there is nothing of Praying to Saints, to Angels, or the bleſſed Virgin; nothing of any Prayers for delivering the deceaſed from pain; nothing of venerating the Croſs or any other Image. The paſſages which look this way, are later Patches tacked to this holy Liturgy in corrupter times, eaſily diſtinguiſhable from the Original compoſure, both by the Stile and Matter; wherefore theſe Parts we reject; but muſt not throw away the Wheat with the Chaff, there being no Father, to which ſome corrupt Additions have not been made; but we muſt not for the ſake of theſe ſpurious Tracts, reject that which is true and genuine. Fourthly, Since it is ſo clear, that Forms had been long uſed in the Church, and that the Gift of Prayer was ceaſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Century began; it cannot but
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:56355:296"/> be very probable that ſo great a Biſhop, of ſo eminent a Dioceſs, and with ſo large a Juriſdiction, ſhould model and correct the ancient Forms, and adapt them to the uſe of the Churches under his care; as S. <hi>Baſil</hi> had done for thoſe under his charge; eſpecially ſince no ancient Author, did ever contradict this Univerſally received Notion, That this Liturgy was made by S. <hi>Chryſoſtom;</hi> Nor doth any Hiſtorian, aſſign any other Perſon as the maker thereof, or mention this Liturgy as coming into uſe, in any other Age.</p>
                     <p n="20">§. 20. And now we will conſider thoſe things which are objected both againſt the uſe of Forms in this Age, and againſt the Authority of this Liturgy; my Adverſary produces divers places out of S. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> to prove, that Words ſpoken in the Celebration of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, were Myſteries, which S. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom</hi> thinks ought to be concealed; and therefore he ſuppoſes there were no Written Forms in his time; however none of his Wrting<note n="(w)" place="margin">Diſcourſe of Liturg. pag. 29. &amp; pag. 35, 36, 37.</note>. I have often anſwered this Argument before: But I ſhall now obſerve, That this Notion of
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:56355:297"/> the great Sin of divulging Myſteries to the Unbaptized, hinders S. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> in his Diſcourſes (which are generally Sermons, Homilies and Orations, made to a promiſcuous Auditory) from giving as many Paſſages of the Eccleſiaſtical Forms, which he generally there wraps up in dark Expreſſions; yet his appeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Faithful, and telling them they knew and remembred ſuch and ſuch things, is a certain ſign, that there were known and preſcribed Forms: For how could he appeal to the Initiated, or tell them they knew or remembred ſuch or ſuch a Paſſage (which he darkly hinted) if Sacraments had been cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated, or Prayers made in the Extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore way, by Phraſes daily varied? Thus in thoſe Inſtances which my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary brings, Speaking of the Litany uſed by the Faithful, S. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſaith, <hi>It is a Myſtery, but the Initiated know how it abounds with Mercy</hi>

<pb n="214" facs="tcp:56355:298"/> durſt not write Forms, as he weakly pretends, but) that they uſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Forms; and theſe being Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries above the Capacity of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized, they feared by often hearing they might learn them, which they fancied was a profanation of their My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries: But had their Prayers been in new Phraſes every day, there had been no need to exclude any Body; they might have challenged them all that were preſent, to remember any thing if they could. This ſilence and ſecrecy therefore, was to ſecure their Forms from the knowledge of the Unbaptized: Though as the Heathens writ their Myſterious Prayers, and yet concealed them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by charging the Prieſts to keep both Books and Forms from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Un-iniated; ſo might the Chriſtians alſo well enough keep their Written Forms ſecret, by charging the Prieſts and Faithful not to diſcover them, and excluding the Catechumens, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever theſe Forms were uſed.

<pb n="222" facs="tcp:56355:302"/> I might here conclude my Vindication of this Holy Father, but that I have met with a Manuſcript Collection of Objections againſt this Liturgy, taken out of <hi>Du-Pleſſis</hi>

                           <hi>Mornay</hi> of the Maſs, Book I. Chap. 6. pag. 50.</note>, which I will briefly Anſwer. Firſt, The Variety of Copies is objected. I Reply, This ſhews the Antiquity and large extent of this Liturgy; and if there be ſome differences in theſe Copies, there are ſo in the very Books of Scripture: And conſidering the many hands which had tranſcribed this Liturgy in all the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of the Syrian and Greek Churches, during the ſpace of 1100 years, before it was printed; the greateſt wonder is, that there were not more Differences. Object. 2. <hi>Some Copies mention Praying for the Dead, and Invocating the Bleſſed Virgin, others do not.</hi> Anſw. It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain thoſe Copies which have leaſt in them, come neareſt to the Original, which (as we have heard) was at firſt Compoſed for abbreviating the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; and we juſtifie nothing which is not very agreeable to S. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>'s un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtioned Works, and to the Doctrin of that Age; there being enough of that kind to aſſure us, there were Forms
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:56355:302"/> of Prayer in this Time. Object. 3 The <hi>Triſagion</hi> is mentioned in this Liturgy, which came not into uſe till one Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years after S. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>'s Time. Anſw. This is falſe, for the Hymn of <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy,</hi> or <hi>Triſagion,</hi> is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by S. <hi>Chryſostom</hi> in his undoubted Works, and by divers Fathers before him. 'Tis true, that addition to it, of <hi>Holy God, Holy Strong, Holy Immortal,</hi> came up one Hundred year after this, and ſome later Copies put in this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; but in the beſt Editions, after the pureſt Manuſcripts, This Hymn is found in the ſimple and primitive Way<note n="(y)" place="margin">Eucholog.

Object. 4. The Word <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, or <hi>Mother of God,</hi> came not in till long after the Time of S. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom;</hi> and if it had been originally in his Liturgy, no doubt it would have been urged againſt the Hereticks. Anſw. This is very true but the genuine Inference is not; therefore all the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy is corrupted; but <hi>therefore all thoſe Prayers to the Bleſſed Virgin, and Hymns wherein ſhe is glorified, are later
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:56355:303"/> Additions to the old genuine Office, which we freely acknowledge.</hi> Object. 5. In this as well as in S. <hi>Baſil,</hi> we find Incenſe offered up for the Remiſſion of Sins; which is Blaſphemy. Aſw. This alſo is a Modern Addition, which hath no foundation is <hi>S. Chryſoſtom</hi>'s Works; and that we may be ſure it is ſo, <hi>Jac. Goar</hi> (the acurate Editor of this Liturgy) tells us, <hi>That the ancient and truly ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine Liturgy begins after this Preface, and all the Ceremony of offering Incenſe is over</hi>
                        <note n="(z)" place="margin">Eucholog. pag. 64.</note>; ſo that it is no wonder to find a Corruption in a part added to it in later times. Object. 6. Divers Perſons are named in this Liturgy, which lived long after S. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>'s Time, <hi>viz. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexius</hi> the Emperour, and <hi>Nicholas</hi> (not Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> but) Biſhop of <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;</hi> and <hi>S. Chryſoſtom</hi> himſelf is there invoked. Anſw. The old Latin Copy printed at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> An. 1560. which was taken out of ſome Manuſcript writ in the Age of that ſame Emperour and Patriarch, had theſe Names: But that is no Argument that this Liturgy was firſt made in that Time, becauſe the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribers put in ſuch as in their Time were to be prayed for; but the New
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:56355:303"/> Editions of theſe Liturgies have no Emperours or Biſhops Name at all, only <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap> leaving it to the Prieſt to add the Names as Perſons changed. To conclude, I have not ſeen one ſolid Objection againſt the main Body of <hi>S. Chryſoſtom</hi>'s Liturgy; and there is enough of that which we defend, and is genuine, to ſhew, that Liturgies were uſed in this Age; and there is clear Evidence and good Reaſon to believe, not only that S. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> approved of Forms, but that he Corrected the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Office, and made all that is Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, pure and primitive, in this very Liturgy, which now goes by his Name.

So that <hi>S. Auguſtin</hi> takes away the main Text, on which our Adverſaries ground their Extempore Prayers, and thinks there is no need for the Spirit to furniſh us with expreſſions.

<pb n="227" facs="tcp:56355:304"/> in every Church, by which care was taken for proper expreſſions; and <hi>S.

                        <note n="(l)" place="margin">Id. de Civ. Dei, lib. 21. cap. 27. p. 232.</note>; yea, he affirms, <hi>The Faithful uſed to ſay theſe Words every day</hi>
                        <note n="(m)" place="margin">Id. Hom. 14. pag. 79.</note>, <hi>and repeated them with united Voices among the holy Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; and therefore he charges all, both Men and Women, to learn this Form</hi>

                        <note n="(o)" place="margin">Id. Hom. 42. pag. 116.</note>. So that the truth of this Matter is, that <hi>S. Auguſtin</hi> plainly declares, Chriſt taught it as a
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:56355:310"/> Form, and ſo the Primitive Chriſtians uſed it; and he only intimates, that it is alſo a direction to draw up other Prayers by, to the ſame ſenſe in other Words; and they made that uſe of it alſo in drawing up Liturgies by that Pattern, and in modelling their private Devotions into Forms, agreeing in ſenſe with this Divine Form, which is the true meaning of that place<note n="(p)" place="margin">Diſcourſe of Lit. pag. 5, &amp; 6. &amp; pag. 60. ex <hi>Aug.</hi> ad <hi>Prob.</hi> Ep, 12.</note>, which he twice cites, <hi>viz.</hi> that it <hi>was lawful to uſe other Words in Prayer, if it were to the ſame ſenſe.</hi> Secondly, He ſaith, <hi>S. Auguſtin</hi> complains, that <hi>ſome of his Brethren uſed Heretical Prayers in their Sacramental Adminiſtrations;</hi> which he ſuppoſes could not have been, if they <hi>had then any allowed Liturgy:</hi> Which Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, according to his Cuſtom, he urges in two ſeveral places<note n="(q)" place="margin">Diſc. of Liturg. p. 46. &amp; p. 113. ex <hi>Aug.</hi> de bapt. contr. Donat. lib. 6. cap. 25.</note>. I Anſwer, That he ought not to have brought this in, to prove there were no Forms for the Euchariſt (as he here doth: See <hi>Diſcourſe of Liturg. pag.</hi> 44.) becauſe the Father is only ſpeaking of Prayers made at Baptiſm, not of Prayers made at the Lords Supper; ſo that he abuſeth his Reader and <hi>S.

                     <pb n="240" facs="tcp:56355:311"/>
                     <p>But Secondly, Theſe Prayers were no eſſential parts of the Office of Baptiſm; there was (as S. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> in this place aſſures us) <hi>a certain Form beſides, which none might vary from; and theſe Biſhops did uſe this Form, which made the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm to be valid, notwithſtanding theſe additional Prayers newly thruſt into the Old Office, which were compoſed by Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, or Babling Perſons</hi>

                        </note>. But it ſeems theſe weak Brethren, (who were alſo Biſhops, and therefore <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin</hi> who was a Biſhop, calls them Brethren,) deſigned to make the Office of Baptiſm more compleat, by adding ſome Prayers before and after the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Form of Baptiſm; and wanting Judgment, choſe either ſilly or Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Prayers for the uſe of their Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes; which indeed ſhewed their want of Judgment, but did not make the Baptiſm Null. This is the true caſe: From whence I obſerve Firſt, That no Argument can be drawn from hence, for the inferior Clergies chooſing their own Forms, or being at liberty to Pray Extempore; for if they Baptized any, they were obliged to uſe the Forms, which their own Biſhop had choſen.
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:56355:311"/> Secondly, Let it be noted, Theſe Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Prayers were Forms compoſed by others, as S. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares; nor doth he cenſure theſe well-meaning Brethren of his, for uſing Forms, but for uſing ſilly or Heretical Forms; which ſhews that the Churches way of Praying then, (even in occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional Offices, ſuch as Baptiſm) was by Forms; and had it been otherwiſe, the putting theſe Forms to an Extempore Office, had been like ſetting a piece of New Cloth, into an Old Garment; wherefore we may reaſonably ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, the old Office which contained the Eſſentials of Baptiſm, that is, the Lords Prayer, the Renunciation, the asking them the Creed, the Prayer of Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and the Hymns, were all certain Forms; but ſome Weak and Ignorant Biſhops, thought this not enough, and would needs add new Compoſures to their ancient Office; but they had ſo ill ſucceſs in this attempt, that I make no doubt, this gave occaſion to the <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> Church at this very time, to Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain that no more Prayers ſhould be added to any part of the Liturgy, which is the Senſe of that Canon of <hi>Carthage,</hi>
                        <pb n="242" facs="tcp:56355:312"/> as I will preſently ſhew. Thirdly, I muſt remark alſo, that the Gift of Prayer, muſt have been ceaſed in <hi>Africa</hi> before this time; becauſe had there been ſuch a Gift, the Biſhops muſt have had it; and then neither would the Unskilful or Heretical have compoſed needleſs Forms, nor theſe weak Biſhops have wanted any ſort of Forms; their very chuſing ſuch compoſures ſhews, they could not make Prayers Extempore. Though they were Ignorant, yet mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Gifts would have enabled theſe, as well as thoſe of greateſt learning, to make Orthodox Prayers on the ſudden. And if the Gift of Prayer was ceaſed, as it was then, and is much more ſo now, it will follow, they needed Forms, as we alſo now generally do. Laſtly, Let it be conſidered the Fact was irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, S. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> cenſures it, and the Church ſaw the ill Conſequences of it; yea, and made a Canon to reſtrain this miſchievous liberty for the Future; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this muſt not be urged for a prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to us, to leave Miniſters at liberty, either to Pray Extempore or chooſe their own Forms; that were to make Faults and things of ill Conſequence, a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern for our imitation.</p>
                     <pb n="243" facs="tcp:56355:312"/>
                     <p>Thirdly, He objects that S. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſaith, <hi>ſome Biſhops and Miniſters called upon God with Soleciſms and Barbariſms;</hi> and he Tauntingly asks, <hi>if theſe Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſms were preſcribed</hi>

But he forgets that the holy Father ſaith there, <hi>None ought to deride them for this,</hi> when he twice makes himſelf Merry with this Rare Argument. The notorious Fallacy whereof will be expoſed, if we conſider that he wilfully miſtakes theſe Sole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſms and Barbariſms, for falſe Grammer and downright Non-ſenſe, that ſo he might fairly pretend, that no Church could preſcribe ſuch Forms.

<pb n="244" facs="tcp:56355:313"/> Now this muſt refer to reading Prayers out of a Book, which ſome of the Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant <hi>Africans,</hi> could not do ſo acurate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after the Roman mode, but that (as S. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> here obſerves;) <hi>Thoſe who came from the Schools of Grammarians and Orators, derided them for this falſe and harſh pronunciation of their Latin, calling theſe miſtakes, Soleciſms and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bariſms.</hi> But the devout Father excuſes theſe Ruſtical Paſtors, and blames thoſe who cenſured them, becauſe God minds the inward devotion more than the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation. So that upon the whole caſe, we may determin, That this inſtance is ſo far from proving Extempore Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were then uſed, or that there was no written Liturgy, that it firſt ſhews theſe could not be Extempore Prayers; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch as could not pronounce La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin truly, could certainly not Pray on the ſudden in that Language. Secondly, It proves there was a Liturgy written in Latin, ſo elegant, that though the <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> Paſtors, and People too underſtood it; yet by reaſon of their rough and harſh Dialect, they could not Read and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce it ſo exactly, as to pleaſe the learned Criticks: However, God did
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:56355:313"/> accept of theſe Forms, thus Ruſtically pronounced, when they were ſaid with true Devotion. So that when our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries deſigned <hi>Sophiſtry</hi> is laid open, this proves an Argument againſt himſelf.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> We are told out of S. <hi>Auguſtin, that one of his Preſbyters, being deſired in his abſence, to Pray in a Houſe infeſted with evil Spirits, Went, and Celebrating the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament there, Prayed with all his Might, that this Vexation might ceaſe, and by Gods mercy it ceaſed preſently</hi>

                        </note>. Now from hence, he draws two Inferences in two diſtant parts of his Book, Firſt, <hi>That the Prayer for all Eſtates of Men, at the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt was not a Form</hi>
                        <note n="(x)" place="margin">Diſc. of Liturg. p. 66.</note>. Secondly, <hi>That there was no Form of Prayer, for this occaſion</hi>

But if the Reader look into his Quotation, he will eaſily obſerve, Firſt, That the Sacrament was over before this Prayer began, and that this was not the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for all Eſtates of Men, (beeauſe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Houſe nor the Devil can be ranked under that head;) but it was a Prayer upon that particular occaſion; for <hi>he Prayed that God would cauſe that
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:56355:314"/> Vexation to ceaſe:</hi> I confeſs he puts a ſtop after <hi>Quantum potuit,</hi> which makes it ſeem as if this Prayer was a part of the Euchariſt; but this pointing is falſe, and his own invention; For S. <hi>Auguſtin</hi>'s Words ſhew, that the Sacrament was firſt Celebrated, and then came this Prayer, wherein he deſired <hi>as earneſtly as he could, that this Vexation might ceaſe.</hi> So that this paſſage is imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently cited to prove, that the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for all Eſtates of Men in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt was not a Form. Secondly, If we grant that <hi>Quantum potuit,</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies <hi>according to his Ability,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates that he Prayed Extempore up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Extraordinary occaſon; All which can be gathered from hence, is, that they had no Form of Prayer in <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica</hi> then, for caſting the Devil out of an Houſe: But that is no Argument to ſhew they had no Forms for public Worſhip, on ordinary occaſions, ſince we have no Form for this extraordinary contigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; but none muſt Argue from thence That we have no Common Prayer. Yet Thirdly, I ſee no Reaſon to grant that <hi>Quantum potuit,</hi> ſignifies any more than that this Presbyter Prayed, <hi>with as
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:56355:314"/> Vigorous a Devotion as he was able, or with all the powers of his Soul;</hi> becauſe it is not a long-winded Prayer, nor variety of new invented Phraſes that the Devil fears, but an earneſt and fervent Prayer: And we could give many Inſtances where this Phraſe is uſed only to denote doing a thing earneſtly and devoutly; one Example ſhall ſuffice at preſent, where the Jews (who always in that Age praiſed God by Forms) are commanded, <hi>when they praiſe God, to exalt him as much as they can</hi>

                     <p>Laſtly, He ſaith, <hi>Auguſtin did not take any offence at the Varieties uſed in the Sacrament, though they were more

Auguſtin</hi> (being only a Biſhop, no Primate or Metropolitan) would not impoſe the Rites uſed in his
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:56355:315"/> own Church upon any: But as to the main parts of this Service, he often obſerves, all Churches did and ought to agree in them. Wherefore it ſhews a want of better Arguments, when he is forced to urge the Variety of Rites in divers Provinces, to prove, that they varied the Prayers themſelves every day; which falſe Notion, neither he nor any of his Friends have or can make out. And this may ſuffice for <hi>S. Auguſtin</hi>'s Judgment and Practice, both which are clearly on our ſide.</p>

This Canon evidently conſiſts of Three parts: The firſt, to correct the irregularity of naming the Father for the Son, or the Son for the Father; and hence my Adverſary infers, That thoſe who were guilty of this Fault, did not uſe preſcribed Forms, and ſuppoſes the Church left them at liberty for the future, to uſe what they thought ſit, only impoſing this on them, Not to name the Father for the Son<note n="(e)" place="margin">Diſcourſe of Liturg. pag. 45.</note>. I Anſwer, This firſt Clauſe (for any thing appears in the Canon) is meant of private Prayers, and ſo is nothing to our Queſtion; it was a Fault com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by private Chriſtians, who had the misfortune to Copy out Heretical Forms. But ſuppoſe the Council refers to thoſe Ignorant Biſhops lately men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in <hi>S. Auguſtin,</hi> who for the uſe of their own Dioceſſes writ out Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Forms, not knowing them to be ſuch, wherein thoſe who held Hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Opinions about the Trinity, had altered theſe Names in favour of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellianiſm</hi> or <hi>Arianiſm:</hi> Theſe were Forms, and no doubt preſcribed by theſe Biſhops to their own Clergy; but the Council rejects all theſe new Forms,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:56355:316"/> and reduceth them to the old Liturgy, which they were ſure was Orthodox, and wherein we ſee the Prayers began with an Addreſs to the Father, and concluded through the Son; ſo that they order, None ſhall begin with the Sons Name, or end with the Fathers: However, it cannot well be underſtood how this Council could prevent ſuch Ignorant perſons from making this Miſtake, but by obliging them to uſe the Churches Forms, where they take it for granted, theſe Names were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways right placed: So that in effect this prohibits all new Forms of Prayer, and binds them to the Old ones, wherein ſuch Inſtances could not be made. And our Adverſary ſuppoſes this Council to be extreme Silly, in ſaying they left ſuch Men (as (he grants<note n="(f)" place="margin">Diſcourſe of Liturg. pag. 46.</note>) were fit to be confined to preſcribed Forms, becauſe they could neither make nor judge of Prayers) to their liberty, to do as they thought fit; this makes the Canon Non-ſenſe, (for how ſhould theſe Men know when they ought to name the Father, and when the Son) and expoſes the whole Council, who could no way prevent
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:56355:317"/> this Miſtake, but by caſting away all ſuch new Forms, and confining all Men to the Old ones; and without ſuppoſing ſuch, we cannot make Senſe of the Canon; which Suppoſition is not made at random, becauſe we have abundantly proved out of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> S. <hi>Cyprian, Optatus,</hi> and S. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> (who was one of this Council) that there were Forms uſed of Ancient time in the <hi>African</hi> Church.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Clauſe of the Canon refers to the public Prayers, all which (and not only thoſe peculiar to the Euchariſt) were then made at the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar: And theſe Prayers were then in the public Forms (as they alſo are now) directed to the Father, which Method none but Hereticks can be ſuppoſed to alter; and leſt any ſhould bring in any Heretical Forms into theſe Offices, the Council (ſuppoſing ſtill the Public Forms were thus made) orders all Prayers at the Altar ſhould be directed to the Father; which is as much as to bind them to the old Forms. I need only here obſerve, the Reaſon why the public Prayers at the Altar were all to be directed to the Father, which is,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:56355:317"/> becauſe Jeſus Chriſt is there ſet forth as the Propitiation for our Sins, and our only Advocate; it is by him and his Redemption there repreſented, that we hope to engage the Father to hear us; <hi>By Him</hi> therefore, and not <hi>To Him,</hi> theſe Prayers muſt be made. Here we declare we only rely on his Intereſt and Interceſſion, and by reaſon of His Death here repreſented, the Sacrament hath been ever eſteemed the moſt effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual way of prevailing with God the Father, to whom therefore, here, our Prayers are moſt properly addreſſed: And ſo they were then, as I could prove, if it were needful, by many Paſſages of the Orthodox Fathers: So that this Clauſe alſo ſuppoſes, the public Forms were rightly drawn up, and forbids any alteration to be made in them in this Point, wherein ſome had been culpable by writing out Heretical Forms, and preſcribing them ignorantly to their own Dioceſſes.</p>
                     <p>As for the laſt Clauſe, our Adverſary reads it falſly; the Words are<note n="(g)" place="margin">Quicunque ſibi preces ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unde deſcribit; <hi>Vera Lectio Canonis.

                        </note>, <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever writes out any Prayers from any other place for himſelf:</hi> But he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts it thus, <hi>What-Prayers-ſoever any
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:56355:318"/> ſhall Copy out for himſelf;</hi> where note, he leaves out the main Word, <hi>Aliunde, From any other place,</hi> which plainly refers to a public and preſcribed Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy; he that writ out any Prayers from thence, need not ſhew them to any; but whoever he were, Biſhop or private Man, that writ out Prayers from any other Form, he was not to uſe them in public, or private, till they had been viewed and judged of by the moſt able Biſhops. Whence we may juſtly infer, Firſt, That there was a Written Liturgy, throughly Orthodox, out of which if any Man writ out any Forms, he was ſure they were right, and need not ſhew them to any, but boldly uſe them either in public or private. Secondly, That ſome itched after other Forms then, as now alſo many do; to reſtrain which dangerous humor, this Council firſt obliges thoſe who did this (whatever they were) to ſhew theſe Forms taken from other places, to the more Judicious; and within a few years another Council allowed no Prayers to be brought in, but ſuch as had been allowed by a Synod. Thirdly, That all this Clauſe
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:56355:318"/> may very well be referred to private Prayers, becauſe it is very probable, that ſome for their private Devotions collected Forms out of the Liturgy; Others tranſcribed them from ſome New Compoſitions; but the Hereticks had been ſo buſie, that the liberty of uſing theſe was not to be allowed, till ſome Judicious Men had viewed and approved them. Laſtly, We may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, That this Clauſe wholly relates to Written Forms; it ſuppoſes the Perſons here ſpoken of, did never pray otherwiſe than by Written Forms; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be explained of public or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Prayers, this is certain, they writ them out of Forms, and after they had Copied them out, uſed them as ſuch: So that this utterly confutes my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, and ſhews, That the general uſe of <hi>Africa</hi> was to pray by Forms. This very plainly proves, the Gift of Prayer was now ceaſed there, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſts their Folly, who pretend in our days, that it is a general Gift. This ſhews, that none did pretend to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempore Prayer, but all either writ out Forms from the public Liturgy, or from ſome other place; wherefore our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:56355:319"/> had a ſingular aſſurance when he produced this Paſſage againſt Written Forms. Theſe were certainly Written Forms: And he had beſt ask, how theſe <hi>African</hi> Chriſtians could look up to Heaven, or mind God alone in Prayer, when they were bound to look on their Books, into which theſe Forms were tranſcribed; or enquire how their Myſteries could be concealed, being written down? This Matter of Fact baffles all his far fetch'd Objections; and let him interpret the whole Canon as he pleaſe, it will ſhew the uſe of Written Forms, and manifeſt the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief of leaving Men at liberty to chooſe Forms for themſelves, even in his own way of expounding; this ſhews ſo many ill Conſequences of varying from the ſtated and eſtabliſhed Forms, that following Councils were forced to enjoyn them more ſtrictly than ever: And his Friends, <hi>Smectymnuus,</hi> were ſo honeſt to confeſs, <hi>That as the</hi> Laodicean <hi>Canon Ordained, None ſhould vary, but always uſe the ſame Form; ſo the</hi> Carthaginian <hi>Canon, further limited the Form</hi>

                        </note> by the more Learned and Judicious. My Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary therefore falſifies the Canon, to impoſe upon his Reader, That any Man might make New Prayers, or pick them up where he pleaſed, and uſe them after he had ſhewed them to the more Diſcreet: But it is plain, that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Canon of <hi>Carthage</hi> hoped to have
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:56355:321"/> kept out Impertinent and Heretical Prayers, by obliging ſuch as had writ out any Forms, to ſhew them to the more diſcreet before they uſed them; which Remedy not proving effectual, This <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> Canon makes a ſtrict Order againſt all manner of Prayers, that had not been Collected out of ſome elder Forms by Judicious Perſons. Having thus diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered his corrupting the Text of this Canon, it will eaſily appear a good Evidence for the uſe of Liturgies: For here is an Office conſiſting of all thoſe Prayers which ought to be uſed at the Altar; and particularly, <hi>Prayers for the Catechumens, Penitents, &amp;c.</hi> and then <hi>Prefaces about Lifting up the Heart, &amp;c. among the Faithful: Interceſſion for all Eſtates of Men,</hi> which is here called <hi>Commendations;</hi> and the <hi>Prayer of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration when the Biſhop laid his Hands on the Bread and Wine, and bleſſed them;</hi> which (I think) is here meant by <hi>Impoſition of Hands.</hi> Theſe primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and eſſential Parts were long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore written down, or elſe how could they have been read or approved in a former Council? And theſe ancient and approved Forms are now again
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:56355:322"/> enjoyned to all that Officiate at the Altar. The reſt of the Canon ſeems to reſpect thoſe Forms which were uſed in other Aſſemblies, and not at the Euchariſt, that is, at the ſeveral Hours of Prayer, in the Morning early, in the Afternoon, and late at Night. And as to theſe, the Council orders, that no Perſon at no time do bring in any Forms contrary to the Faith; to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent which unavoidable Conſequence of Extempore Prayers, and leaving Men at liberty to collect their own Forms, this Council decrees, <hi>That thoſe Prayers only ſhall be ſaid in the Church</hi> (I ſuppoſe at the Hours of Prayer) <hi>which had formerly been collected out of ancient Forms, by ſuch as could judge whether they were Orthodox, and fit for Public uſe.</hi> And the Canon of <hi>Milevis,</hi> rightly Tranſlated (being a Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Canon in the beginning of the next Century) juſtifies this clear and plain Expoſition: The Words are theſe; <hi>It alſo ſeems good, that the Prayers, Supplications and Maſſes, which have been approved in Council, whether Prefaces, Commendations, or Impoſitions of Hands, ſhall be celebrated by all;
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:56355:322"/> and that no other Prayers ſhall be ſaid in the Church, but ſuch as have been Compoſed by the Judicious, or Approved in the Council, leſt by this means, through Ignorance or Negligence, any thing be Compoſed contrary to the Faith</hi>

But my Adverſary is not ſo ingenuous; yet his Objections are ſo manifeſtly Miſtakes, that to Repeat them, is enough to Anſwer them<note n="(t)" place="margin">Diſcourſe of Litu g. pag. 49, &amp;c.</note>: Firſt, he ſaith, The <hi>African</hi> Canon left them at liberty <hi>to uſe any Prayers that were allowed by ſome Prudent Brethren, or Synod; and</hi> (he adds) <hi>they deſire no more liberty than this.</hi> I Anſwer, The Canon enjoyns the Euchariſtical Forms, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been eſtabliſhed before; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows no Prayers, but Forms in any other Office; and there is nothing in the true Reading, concerning the allowance of prudent Men, that is his own Corruption. And if his Bretheren are content to uſe Forms, compoſed by prudent Men in former time, and approved by a Synod; the Common-Prayer is ſuch a Form, and therefore they muſt conform to it. Secondly, He ſaith, <hi>No Prayers are
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:56355:323"/> forbid, but ſuch as are againſt the Faith</hi>
                        <note n="(u)" place="margin">Diſc. of Liturg. pag. 50.</note>. I anſwer, all Prayers but thoſe which had been approved formerly in a Council, are forbid in the Euchariſt, which was then daily Adminiſtred; and ſo this was the only Solemn Office of Prayers. And even at other times, to prevent Heretical Prayers, they forbid all new Forms from being brought into the Church; Therefore if any then had pretended to the Gift of Prayer, and had made new Forms for the Euchariſt, or the hours of Prayer, though they were not againſt the Faith, yet theſe Canons forbid them. Thirdly, He fills his Margen, to ſhew in how many Offices, impoſition of hands were uſed<note n="(w)" place="margin">Diſc. of Liturg. p. 51.</note>; and then pretends that his feigned liberty was allowed in the Prayers, uſed in all theſe ſeveral Offices. I anſwer, <hi>The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Hands in this Canon,</hi> muſt ſignify ſome part of the Euchariſtical Office; ſomthing done at the Altar in the Adminiſtration; and it is expreſly ordered, that no Prayers ſhall be uſed in this laying on of Hands, (which I take to be the conſecrating the Elements) but ſuch as had before been confirmed by a Synod. Wherefore in this point,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:56355:324"/> there was no liberty at all left, but every one was confined to the old eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed Form. Fourthly, He raiſes divers other ſcruples, but they all rely upon his own falſe Tranſlating of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non<note n="(x)" place="margin">Diſc. of Liturg. p. 53. 54</note>, and may be here paſſed by, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are anſwered before. Laſtly, He repreſents <hi>Chemnitius,</hi> as falſly as he had done the Council, ſaying, <hi>that he cites theſe two Canons to prove, the Order of Celebrating among the Ancients was Arbitrary</hi>
                        <note n="(y)" place="margin">Diſc. of Liturg. p. 55.</note>. I anſwer, <hi>Chemnitius</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing the Roman Churches impoſing her Canon of the Maſs, upon all Churches, under pretence that no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration can be without it. And he ſhews that in the ancient Church, there was not one certain Form of Words, which all the Churches in the World were bound to uſe, under the peril of mortal Sin, it being free for them to uſe any Form that agreed to the Faith; which he proves by theſe two Canons, and by this Argument, becauſe the Greeks had one Form in <hi>Dionyſius</hi> his Church, <hi>another in</hi> Baſils, and <hi>another in</hi> Chryſoſtoms. In the Weſt alſo S. <hi>Ambroſe uſed one Form,</hi> Iſidore <hi>another, and</hi> Gregory <hi>another, who yet would not impoſe the Roman Form upon</hi>

Therefore if this Author be a good Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, he owns Liturgies in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church, and juſtifies the uſe of them in the Reformed Churches; he condemns nothing but impoſing one Liturgy upon all the Churches in the World; to conceal which my Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary in citing <hi>Chemenitius,</hi> draws a line —where theſe Words come in.— <hi>To which all Churches in the World were bound under the peril of mortal Sin:</hi> Which words ſhew <hi>Chemnitius</hi> diſliked mainly the binding all Churches, to uſe one Churches Form. But as to theſe two Canons <hi>Bellarmine</hi> juſtly reproves <hi>Chemnitius</hi> for applying thoſe parts of them which forbid ſuch Prayers as are againſt the Faith, to the Euchariſtical Prayers; becauſe they belong (as we have ſhewed) to Prayers uſed in the Church at other times<note n="(a)" place="margin">
                           <hi>Bellarm.</hi> de Miſſâ lib. 2. cap. 18.</note>. And I dare ſay <hi>Chemnitius</hi> did not think, That the public Prayers were Arbitrary in the
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:56355:325"/> Primitive Church, in my Adverſaries Senſe; that is, that private Miniſters were allowed to Pray Extempore, or to make Forms of their own; nor did he think, it would be allowed to the inferior Clergy, to uſe <hi>(ſuppoſe) Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> his Form in S. <hi>Baſils</hi> Church; it is plain from his Argument, and the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran</hi> Churches practice, that the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of every Province were bound to uſe the Forms, preſcribed by that Church whereof they were Members. And this is the obligation, which our Church puts upon all her Clergy, which our Diſſenters moſt unjuſtly complain of; ſince we ſee it hath been always done by all the Regular, and well ſetled na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Churches in the World.</p>
                     <p>I have now done with this eminent Century, and proved, That as Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity was firſt ſetled and eſtabliſhed by Law in this Age, ſo were Liturgies alſo: So that we ſhall conclude this Period with our Adverſaries Character of this Time, <hi>Many there were</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>excellently accompliſhed in the Fourth Age, and ſome till about the middle of the Fifth; it may therefore ſeem ſomething for the Credit of Liturgies, if they can be found

                        <note n="(b)" place="margin">Diſc. of Liturg. p. 55.</note>. Wherefore having made it appear, that Liturgies were uſed even in the Three firſt Ages, which he pretends ſo much to admire; and being ſetled by Law and cuſtom ſo firmly in this Age, which abounded with more and more learned Fathers than all the Ages before it, we may conclude, That to Pray by a preſcribed Liturgy, is to pray according to the uſage of the beſt Times of the Church, and to pray agreeably to the Opinion, and practice of the moſt Learned Pious and Eminent Fathers; whoſe judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment if our Adverſaries had any Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence for, they would certainly comply with ſo pure and Primitive a Liturgy, as that which is preſcribed by the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Church of <hi>England,</hi> the undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Bulwark of the True Proteſtant Religion.</p>
